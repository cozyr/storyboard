            <em>The Lightning Thief</em> follows twelve-year-old Percy Jackson as he discovers the world of Greek mythology
            is real—and dangerously tangled up with his life—when he’s suddenly accused in a divine crisis and forced into
            a cross-country quest with new allies, racing monsters and time itself to clear his name and keep the gods from
            turning on each other.

                    <p>Percy Jackson warns readers not to dig too deep into the truth about half-bloods, then introduces himself as a twelve-year-old trouble magnet at Yancy Academy, a boarding school in upstate New York.</p>
                    <img class="scene-img" src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/1-1.png" alt="Scene image" />
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p>He flashes back to last May, when his sixth-grade class piled onto a yellow bus for a field trip to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in Manhattan, hoping—against all odds—this one won’t end in disaster.</p>
                    <img class="scene-img" src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/1-2.png" alt="Scene image" />
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p>Percy’s only real comfort is Mr. Brunner, the Latin teacher in a motorized wheelchair, who’s oddly cool and makes Greek and Roman history feel alive. Percy’s determined to stay out of trouble this time.</p>
                    <img class="scene-img" src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/1-3.png" alt="Scene image" />
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p>On the ride into the city, Percy bites his tongue while Nancy Bobofit pelts his best friend Grover with chunks of peanut-butter-and-ketchup sandwich. Grover tries to keep Percy calm, reminding him he’s already on probation.</p>
                    <img class="scene-img" src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/1-4.png" alt="Scene image" />
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p>At the museum, Mr. Brunner leads them through echoing galleries of statues and ancient pottery, stopping at a tall stone column topped with a sphinx. Percy tries to listen, but the noise of his class keeps pulling him into trouble—especially under Mrs. Dodds’s watchful glare.</p>
                    <img class="scene-img" src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/1-5.png" alt="Scene image" />
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p>When Nancy makes a crude joke, Percy snaps at her a little too loud, and Mr. Brunner puts him on the spot with questions about a carving. Percy manages to explain the myth of Kronos, but he can’t answer why it matters in real life.</p>
                    <img class="scene-img" src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/1-6.png" alt="Scene image" />
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p>After lunch is announced, Mr. Brunner pulls Percy aside and tells him he needs to understand why what he’s learning is important, pushing him harder than any teacher ever has. Percy walks away frustrated, feeling like he can’t live up to expectations.</p>
                    <img class="scene-img" src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/1-7.png" alt="Scene image" />
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p>Outside on the museum steps, Percy notices an unnaturally dark storm building over the city while everyone else acts like it’s normal. He sits by a fountain with Grover, wishing he could just go home instead of waiting for the next punishment.</p>
                    <img class="scene-img" src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/1-8.png" alt="Scene image" />
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p>Nancy marches over and dumps her half-eaten lunch into Grover’s lap, and Percy’s temper finally snaps. In the next instant, Nancy is splashing in the fountain, screaming that Percy pushed her—while other kids swear the water itself seemed to grab her.</p>
                    <img class="scene-img" src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/1-9.png" alt="Scene image" />
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p>Mrs. Dodds appears instantly, thrilled to have Percy in her sights, and orders him to come with her despite Grover desperately trying to take the blame. Percy follows, unsettled by how she keeps reappearing impossibly far ahead, like reality is skipping.</p>
                    <img class="scene-img" src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/1-10.png" alt="Scene image" />
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p>She leads Percy deep into an empty Greek gallery, stopping in front of a marble frieze of the gods, her voice low and threatening. She accuses him like she’s been hunting him, demanding he confess to something Percy doesn’t even understand.</p>
                    <img class="scene-img" src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/1-11.png" alt="Scene image" />
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p>Thunder shakes the building as Mrs. Dodds transforms—eyes blazing, fingers turning to claws, leather jacket melting into wings—revealing a shriveled, fanged monster ready to tear Percy apart. Percy can barely move, trapped between panic and disbelief.</p>
                    <img class="scene-img" src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/1-12.png" alt="Scene image" />
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p>Mr. Brunner suddenly bursts into the doorway and throws Percy a pen, shouting like it’s a drill. Percy catches it, and it becomes a bronze sword in his hands just as the monster lunges.</p>
                    <img class="scene-img" src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/1-13.png" alt="Scene image" />
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p>With no time to think, Percy swings the sword in pure instinct, and the blade slices through Mrs. Dodds like she’s made of water. She disintegrates into yellow powder with a sulfurous screech, leaving Percy trembling and suddenly alone.</p>
                    <img class="scene-img" src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/1-14.png" alt="Scene image" />
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p>In the blink of an eye, the gallery is normal again—no monster, no teacher—just Percy holding an ordinary ballpoint pen. He stumbles outside into the rain, half-convinced he hallucinated the whole thing.</p>
                    <img class="scene-img" src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/1-15.png" alt="Scene image" />
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p>Back by the fountain, Nancy is still soaked and insults Percy, but calls their chaperone “Mrs. Kerr,” acting like Mrs. Dodds never existed. Grover also pretends not to know the name, and even Mr. Brunner calmly insists there has never been a Mrs. Dodds at Yancy—or on the trip.</p>

                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p>After the museum incident, Percy can’t shake the feeling that reality has been rewritten. Everyone at Yancy insists Mrs. Kerr—a cheerful blond Percy swears he’s never met—has been the pre-algebra teacher since Christmas, and every “Mrs. Dodds” reference earns him blank stares.</p>
                    <img class="scene-img" src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/2-1.png" alt="Scene image" />
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p>Grover’s reactions are the only crack in the act—he always hesitates before denying Mrs. Dodds, like he’s forcing the lie out. At night, Percy keeps jolting awake, seeing wings and talons in his nightmares.</p>
                    <img class="scene-img" src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/2-2.png" alt="Scene image" />
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p>The weather stays violent and unnatural, rattling Percy’s nerves even more—storms, tornado reports, freak squalls in the news. As everything feels more wrong, Percy gets angrier, fights more, and his grades slide fast.</p>
                    <img class="scene-img" src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/2-3.png" alt="Scene image" />
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p>Eventually Percy explodes in English class, insults Mr. Nicoll, and seals his fate. A letter goes home, and the school makes it official: he won’t be coming back next year.</p>
                    <img class="scene-img" src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/2-4.png" alt="Scene image" />
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p>Even though he’s homesick and wants his mom, Percy realizes there are things he’ll miss—Grover, the woods and river views, and especially Mr. Brunner’s Latin class. With exams closing in, Latin becomes the one subject he tries to study, because Brunner’s “life-and-death” warning keeps echoing in his head.</p>
                    <img class="scene-img" src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/2-5.png" alt="Scene image" />
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p>The night before the final, frustration boils over—Percy hurls his mythology book across the room as the words seem to twist and spin off the page. After pacing like his skin is crawling, he forces himself to pick the book back up and decides to ask Mr. Brunner for help.</p>
                    <img class="scene-img" src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/2-6.png" alt="Scene image" />
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p>Down in the dim faculty hallway, Mr. Brunner’s office is the only one with light spilling out. Percy stops short when he hears Brunner and Grover talking about him—worried voices, strange phrases, and the chilling idea that something is watching Percy already.</p>
                    <img class="scene-img" src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/2-7.png" alt="Scene image" />
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p>Percy hears enough to make his stomach drop: “Kindly One,” “the Mist,” “keep Percy alive,” and a “summer solstice deadline.” Then his book thuds to the floor, and silence hits like a trap snapping shut.</p>
                    <img class="scene-img" src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/2-8.png" alt="Scene image" />
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p>A shadow slides across the frosted glass—taller than Mr. Brunner’s wheelchair, holding something shaped like a bow. Percy ducks into the nearest room and waits, hearing slow clopping footsteps and an animal-like snuffle right outside his door.</p>
                    <img class="scene-img" src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/2-9.png" alt="Scene image" />

                    <p>Eventually the hallway calms; Brunner dismisses Grover back to the dorm, the office lights click off, and Percy finally slips away. When he returns, Grover is in bed acting normal, as if he never left—studying like he’s been there all night.</p>

                    <p>Percy tries to play it off, but inside he’s rattled—Grover and Mr. Brunner have been hiding something, and they think Percy is in real danger. He goes to sleep not believing any of it, yet unable to forget a word.</p>
                    <img class="scene-img" src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/2-11.png" alt="Scene image" />
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p>After the brutal three-hour Latin exam, Mr. Brunner stops Percy and speaks gently about him leaving Yancy, saying it’s for the best and that this place was never right for him. Percy hears it like rejection, especially with Nancy smirking nearby, and he storms out before Brunner can explain.</p>

                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p>On the last day, Percy packs while rich kids brag about their vacations, barely noticing him when he says he’s heading back to the city. The one goodbye he dreads—Grover—doesn’t happen, because Grover is getting on the same Greyhound to Manhattan.</p>
                    <img class="scene-img" src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/2-13.png" alt="Scene image" />
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p>During the ride, Grover keeps scanning the aisle like he expects trouble, and Percy finally confronts him with what he overheard. Grover panics, tries to lie it away, but he’s so bad at it that Percy pushes harder.</p>
                    <img class="scene-img" src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/2-14.png" alt="Scene image" />
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p>Grover ends up handing Percy a grimy business card with strange words—“Keeper” and “Half-Blood Hill”—and begs him not to say the name out loud. Percy’s mood twists from confusion to hurt, thinking Grover has some secret rich summer life he never mentioned.</p>
                    <img class="scene-img" src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/2-15.png" alt="Scene image" />
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p>Then Grover blurts out something even stranger: he has to protect Percy. Percy is about to demand what that even means when the bus shudders, black smoke pours from the dashboard, and a rotten-egg stench fills the air.</p>
                    <img class="scene-img" src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/2-16.png" alt="Scene image" />
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p>Everyone gets off on a lonely stretch of highway, heat shimmering off the asphalt. Across the road sits a quaint fruit stand—bright cherries and cider in ice—but three ancient women in rocking chairs sit knitting gigantic electric-blue socks and staring directly at Percy.</p>
                    <img class="scene-img" src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/2-17.png" alt="Scene image" />
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p>Grover turns ghost-pale and begs Percy to get back on the bus immediately. Percy hesitates, watching as the middle woman lifts huge scissors and snips the yarn with a sound that feels louder than it should.</p>
                    <img class="scene-img" src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/2-18.png" alt="Scene image" />
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p>The driver manages to restart the bus, everyone cheers, and they climb back on—but the relief doesn’t last. As the Greyhound rolls away, Percy feels feverish, and Grover starts shivering like he’s freezing in the heat.</p>
                    <img class="scene-img" src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/2-19.png" alt="Scene image" />
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p>Percy tells Grover exactly what he saw—the scissors cutting the yarn—and Grover reacts like it’s a death sentence. He mutters about sixth graders never making it past sixth grade, like he’s seen this happen before.</p>
                    <img class="scene-img" src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/2-20.png" alt="Scene image" />
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p>Grover begs to walk Percy home from the bus station and won’t explain why. When Percy finally asks the obvious—does the snipping mean someone’s going to die—Grover looks at him with a grief so heavy it feels like Percy’s funeral has already been planned.</p>
