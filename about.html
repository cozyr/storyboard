            <h2>What is Story Board?</h2>
            <p>
                Story Board is a visual timeline-style archive for book series and standalone stories.
                Instead of full chapter text, each chapter is presented as a clean sequence of short summaries,
                paired with scene highlight images underneath.
            </p>
            <p>
                The goal is to keep everything chronological and easy to follow — like flipping through a storyboard.
                It’s meant to feel calm, organized, and fun to revisit.
            </p>

            <h2>How the chapters work</h2>
            <p>
                Each chapter contains small event summaries in order, with no skipped moments in between.
                Under every summary is a matching scene highlight image to support the timeline visually.
            </p>
            <p>
                This keeps the site lightweight and avoids including copyrighted book text,
                while still preserving the story structure in a storyboard format.
            </p>
