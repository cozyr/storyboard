            <h2>What is Story Board?</h2>
            <p>
                Story Board is a personal archive for standalone books, built as a calm visual “chapter map.”
                Each chapter is broken into short, chronological summaries, paired with scene images to make the story easy to revisit.
            </p>
            <p>
                It’s designed to feel like flipping through a storyboard—quick to scan, easy to remember, and satisfying to browse.

            <h2>How chapters are structured</h2>
            <p>
                Chapters are presented as a sequence of key story beats in order. Smaller moments are grouped into the closest major event,
                so each scene earns its place visually.
            </p>
            <p>
                The focus is on clarity and progression: each summary moves the story forward, and each image represents a distinct moment.
