                    <p class="calibre13"><span class="bigcap">L</span>ook, I didn’t want to be a half-blood. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">If you’re reading this because you think you might be one, my advice is: close
                        this book right
                        now. Believe whatever lie your mom or dad told you about your birth, and try to lead a normal
                        life. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Being a half-blood is dangerous. It’s scary. Most of the time, it gets you
                        killed in painful,
                        nasty ways. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">If you’re a normal kid, reading this because you think it’s fiction, great.
                        Read on. I envy you
                        for being able to believe that none of this ever happened. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">But if you recognize yourself in these pages—if you feel something stirring
                        inside—stop reading
                        immediately. You might be one of us. And once you know that, it’s only a matter of time before
                        <em class="calibre5">they </em>sense it too, and they’ll come for you.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Don’t say I didn’t warn you. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">My name is Percy Jackson. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I’m twelve years old. Until a few months ago, I was a boarding student at Yancy
                        Academy, a
                        private school for troubled kids in upstate New York. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Am I a troubled kid? </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Yeah. You could say that. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I could start at any point in my short miserable life to prove it, but things
                        really started
                        going bad last May, when our sixth-grade class took a field trip to Manhattan—twenty-eight
                        mental-case kids and
                        two teachers on a yellow school bus, heading to the Metropolitan Museum of Art to look at
                        ancient Greek and
                        Roman stuff. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I know—it sounds like torture. Most Yancy field trips were. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">But Mr. Brunner, our Latin teacher, was leading this trip, so I had hopes. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Mr. Brunner was this middle-aged guy in a motorized wheelchair. He had thinning
                        hair and a
                        scruffy beard and a frayed tweed jacket, which always smelled like coffee. You wouldn’t think
                        he’d be cool, but
                        he told stories and jokes and let us play games in class. He also had this awesome collection of
                        Roman armor and
                        weapons, so he was the only teacher whose class didn’t put me to sleep. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I hoped the trip would be okay. At least, I hoped that for once I wouldn’t get
                        in trouble. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Boy, was I wrong. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">See, bad things happen to me on field trips. Like at my fifth-grade school,
                        when we went to the
                        Saratoga battlefield, I had this accident with a Revolutionary War cannon. I wasn’t aiming for
                        the school bus,
                        but of course I got expelled anyway. And before that, at my fourth-grade school, when we took a
                        behind-the-scenes tour of the Marine World shark pool, I sort of hit the wrong lever on the
                        catwalk and our
                        class took an unplanned swim. And the time before that…Well, you get the idea. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">This trip, I was determined to be good. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">All the way into the city, I put up with Nancy Bobofit, the freckly, redheaded
                        kleptomaniac
                        girl, hitting my best friend Grover in the back of the head with chunks of peanut
                        butter-and-ketchup sandwich.
                    </p>
                    <img class="scene-img" src="../assets/images/scenes/1-1.png" alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover was an easy target. He was scrawny. He cried when he got frustrated. He
                        must’ve been
                        held back several grades, because he was the only sixth grader with acne and the start of a
                        wispy beard on his
                        chin. On top of all that, he was crippled. He had a note excusing him from PE for the rest of
                        his life because
                        he had some kind of muscular disease in his legs. He walked funny, like every step hurt him, but
                        don’t let that
                        fool you. You should’ve seen him run when it was enchilada day in the cafeteria. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Anyway, Nancy Bobofit was throwing wads of sandwich that stuck in his curly
                        brown hair, and she
                        knew I couldn’t do anything back to her because I was already on probation. The headmaster had
                        threatened me
                        with death by in-school suspension if anything bad, embarrassing, or even mildly entertaining
                        happened on this
                        trip. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m going to kill her,” I mumbled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover tried to calm me down. “It’s okay. I like peanut butter.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He dodged another piece of Nancy’s lunch. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“That’s it.” I started to get up, but Grover pulled me back to my seat. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’re already on probation,” he reminded me. “You know who’ll get blamed if
                        anything
                        happens.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Looking back on it, I wish I’d decked Nancy Bobofit right then and there.
                        In-school suspension
                        would’ve been nothing compared to the mess I was about to get myself into. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">Mr. Brunner led the museum tour. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He rode up front in his wheelchair, guiding us through the big echoey
                        galleries, past marble
                        statues and glass cases full of really old black-and-orange pottery. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It blew my mind that this stuff had survived for two thousand, three thousand
                        years. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He gathered us around a thirteen-foot-tall stone column with a big sphinx on
                        the top, and
                        started telling us how it was a grave marker, a <em class="calibre5">stele</em>, for a girl
                        about our age. He
                        told us about the carvings on the sides. I was trying to listen to what he had to say, because
                        it was kind of
                        interesting, but everybody around me was talking, and every time I told them to shut up, the
                        other teacher
                        chaperone, Mrs. Dodds, would give me the evil eye. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img" src="../assets/images/scenes/1-2.png" alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">Mrs. Dodds was this little math teacher from Georgia who always wore a black
                        leather jacket,
                        even though she was fifty years old. She looked mean enough to ride a Harley right into your
                        locker. She had
                        come to Yancy halfway through the year, when our last math teacher had a nervous breakdown. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">From her first day, Mrs. Dodds loved Nancy Bobofit and figured I was devil
                        spawn. She would
                        point her crooked finger at me and say, “Now, honey,” real sweet, and I knew I was going to get
                        after-school
                        detention for a month. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">One time, after she’d made me erase answers out of old math workbooks until
                        midnight, I told
                        Grover I didn’t think Mrs. Dodds was human. He looked at me, real serious, and said, “You’re
                        absolutely right.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Mr. Brunner kept talking about Greek funeral art. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Finally, Nancy Bobofit snickered something about the naked guy on the stele,
                        and I turned
                        around and said, “Will you <em class="calibre5">shut up</em>?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It came out louder than I meant it to. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The whole group laughed. Mr. Brunner stopped his story. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Mr. Jackson,” he said, “did you have a comment?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My face was totally red. I said, “No, sir.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Mr. Brunner pointed to one of the pictures on the stele. “Perhaps you’ll tell
                        us what this
                        picture represents?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I looked at the carving, and felt a flush of relief, because I actually
                        recognized it. “That’s
                        Kronos eating his kids, right?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yes,” Mr. Brunner said, obviously not satisfied. “And he did this because…”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Well…” I racked my brain to remember. “Kronos was the king god, and—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“God?” Mr. Brunner asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Titan,” I corrected myself. “And…he didn’t trust his kids, who were the gods.
                        So, um, Kronos
                        ate them, right? But his wife hid baby Zeus, and gave Kronos a rock to eat instead. And later,
                        when Zeus grew
                        up, he tricked his dad, Kronos, into barfing up his brothers and sisters—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Eeew!” said one of the girls behind me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“—and so there was this big fight between the gods and the Titans,” I
                        continued, “and the gods
                        won.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Some snickers from the group. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Behind me, Nancy Bobofit mumbled to a friend, “Like we’re going to use this in
                        real life. Like
                        it’s going to say on our job applications, ‘Please explain why Kronos ate his kids.’” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“And why, Mr. Jackson,” Brunner said, “to paraphrase Miss Bobofit’s excellent
                        question, does
                        this matter in real life?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Busted,” Grover muttered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Shut up,” Nancy hissed, her face even brighter red than her hair. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">At least Nancy got packed, too. Mr. Brunner was the only one who ever caught
                        her saying
                        anything wrong. He had radar ears. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I thought about his question, and shrugged. “I don’t know, sir.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“I see.” Mr. Brunner looked disappointed. “Well, half credit, Mr. Jackson. Zeus
                        did indeed feed
                        Kronos a mixture of mustard and wine, which made him disgorge his other five children, who, of
                        course, being
                        immortal gods, had been living and growing up completely undigested in the Titan’s stomach. The
                        gods defeated
                        their father, sliced him to pieces with his own scythe, and scattered his remains in Tartarus,
                        the darkest part
                        of the Underworld. On that happy note, it’s time for lunch. Mrs. Dodds, would you lead us back
                        outside?” </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">The class drifted off, the girls holding their stomachs, the guys pushing each
                        other around and
                        acting like doofuses. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover and I were about to follow when Mr. Brunner said, “Mr. Jackson.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I knew that was coming. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I told Grover to keep going. Then I turned toward Mr. Brunner. “Sir?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Mr. Brunner had this look that wouldn’t let you go—intense brown eyes that
                        could’ve been a
                        thousand years old and had seen everything. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You must learn the answer to my question,” Mr. Brunner told me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“About the Titans?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“About real life. And how your studies apply to it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What you learn from me,” he said, “is vitally important. I expect you to treat
                        it as such. I
                        will accept only the best from you, Percy Jackson.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I wanted to get angry, this guy pushed me so hard. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I mean, sure, it was kind of cool on tournament days, when he dressed up in a
                        suit of Roman
                        armor and shouted: “What ho!” and challenged us, sword-point against chalk, to run to the board
                        and name every
                        Greek and Roman person who had ever lived, and their mother, and what god they worshipped. But
                        Mr. Brunner
                        expected me to be as good as everybody else, despite the fact that I have dyslexia and attention
                        deficit
                        disorder and I had never made above a C– in my life. No—he didn’t expect me to be <em
                            class="calibre5">as
                            good</em>; he expected me to be <em class="calibre5">better</em>. And I just couldn’t learn
                        all those names
                        and facts, much less spell them correctly. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I mumbled something about trying harder, while Mr. Brunner took one long sad
                        look at the stele,
                        like he’d been at this girl’s funeral. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He told me to go outside and eat my lunch. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">The class gathered on the front steps of the museum, where we could watch the
                        foot traffic
                        along Fifth Avenue. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Overhead, a huge storm was brewing, with clouds blacker than I’d ever seen over
                        the city. I
                        figured maybe it was global warming or something, because the weather all across New York state
                        had been weird
                        since Christmas. We’d had massive snow storms, flooding, wildfires from lightning strikes. I
                        wouldn’t have been
                        surprised if this was a hurricane blowing in. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Nobody else seemed to notice. Some of the guys were pelting pigeons with
                        Lunchables crackers.
                        Nancy Bobofit was trying to pickpocket something from a lady’s purse, and, of course, Mrs. Dodds
                        wasn’t seeing a
                        thing. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover and I sat on the edge of the fountain, away from the others. We thought
                        that maybe if we
                        did that, everybody wouldn’t know we were from <em class="calibre5">that </em>school—the school
                        for loser freaks
                        who couldn’t make it elsewhere. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Detention?” Grover asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Nah,” I said. “Not from Brunner. I just wish he’d lay off me sometimes. I
                        mean—I’m not a
                        genius.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover didn’t say anything for a while. Then, when I thought he was going to
                        give me some deep
                        philosophical comment to make me feel better, he said, “Can I have your apple?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I didn’t have much of an appetite, so I let him take it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I watched the stream of cabs going down Fifth Avenue, and thought about my
                        mom’s apartment,
                        only a little ways uptown from where we sat. I hadn’t seen her since Christmas. I wanted so bad
                        to jump in a
                        taxi and head home. She’d hug me and be glad to see me, but she’d be disappointed, too. She’d
                        send me right back
                        to Yancy, remind me that I had to try harder, even if this was my sixth school in six years and
                        I was probably
                        going to be kicked out again. I wouldn’t be able to stand that sad look she’d give me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Mr. Brunner parked his wheelchair at the base of the handicapped ramp. He ate
                        celery while he
                        read a paperback novel. A red umbrella stuck up from the back of his chair, making it look like
                        a motorized café
                        table. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I was about to unwrap my sandwich when Nancy Bobofit appeared in front of me
                        with her ugly
                        friends—I guess she’d gotten tired of stealing from the tourists—and dumped her half-eaten lunch
                        in Grover’s
                        lap. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oops.” She grinned at me with her crooked teeth. Her freckles were orange, as
                        if somebody had
                        spray-painted her face with liquid Cheetos. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I tried to stay cool. The school counselor had told me a million times, “Count
                        to ten, get
                        control of your temper.” But I was so mad my mind went blank. A wave roared in my ears. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I don’t remember touching her, but the next thing I knew, Nancy was sitting on
                        her butt in the
                        fountain, screaming, “Percy pushed me!” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img" src="../assets/images/scenes/1-3.png" alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">Mrs. Dodds materialized next to us. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Some of the kids were whispering: “Did you see—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“—the water—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“—like it grabbed her—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I didn’t know what they were talking about. All I knew was that I was in
                        trouble again. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">As soon as Mrs. Dodds was sure poor little Nancy was okay, promising to get her
                        a new shirt at
                        the museum gift shop, etc., etc., Mrs. Dodds turned on me. There was a triumphant fire in her
                        eyes, as if I’d
                        done something she’d been waiting for all semester. “Now, honey—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I know,” I grumbled. “A month erasing workbooks.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">That wasn’t the right thing to say. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Come with me,” Mrs. Dodds said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Wait!” Grover yelped. “It was me. <em class="calibre5">I </em>pushed her.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stared at him, stunned. I couldn’t believe he was trying to cover for me.
                        Mrs. Dodds scared
                        Grover to death. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She glared at him so hard his whiskery chin trembled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I don’t think so, Mr. Underwood,” she said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You—<em class="calibre5">will</em>—stay—here.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover looked at me desperately. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It’s okay, man,” I told him. “Thanks for trying.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Honey,” Mrs. Dodds barked at me. <em class="calibre5">“Now.” </em></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Nancy Bobofit smirked. I gave her my deluxe I’ll-kill-you-later stare. Then I
                        turned to face
                        Mrs. Dodds, but she wasn’t there. She was standing at the museum entrance, way at the top of the
                        steps,
                        gesturing impatiently at me to come on. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">How’d she get there so fast? </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I have moments like that a lot, when my brain falls asleep or something, and
                        the next thing I
                        know I’ve missed something, as if a puzzle piece fell out of the universe and left me staring at
                        the blank place
                        behind it. The school counselor told me this was part of the ADHD, my brain misinterpreting
                        things. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I wasn’t so sure. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I went after Mrs. Dodds. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Halfway up the steps, I glanced back at Grover. He was looking pale, cutting
                        his eyes between
                        me and Mr. Brunner, like he wanted Mr. Brunner to notice what was going on, but Mr. Brunner was
                        absorbed in his
                        novel. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I looked back up. Mrs. Dodds had disappeared again. She was now inside the
                        building, at the end
                        of the entrance hall. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Okay, I thought. She’s going to make me buy a new shirt for Nancy at the gift
                        shop. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">But apparently that wasn’t the plan. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I followed her deeper into the museum. When I finally caught up to her, we were
                        back in the
                        Greek and Roman section. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Except for us, the gallery was empty. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Mrs. Dodds stood with her arms crossed in front of a big marble frieze of the
                        Greek gods. She
                        was making this weird noise in her throat, like growling. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Even without the noise, I would’ve been nervous. It’s weird being alone with a
                        teacher,
                        especially Mrs. Dodds. Something about the way she looked at the frieze, as if she wanted to
                        pulverize it…</p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’ve been giving us problems, honey,” she said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I did the safe thing. I said, “Yes, ma’am.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She tugged on the cuffs of her leather jacket. “Did you really think you would
                        get away with
                        it?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The look in her eyes was beyond mad. It was evil. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She’s a teacher, I thought nervously. It’s not like she’s going to hurt me.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I said, “I’ll—I’ll try harder, ma’am.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Thunder shook the building. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We are not fools, Percy Jackson,” Mrs. Dodds said. “It was only a matter of
                        time before we
                        found you out. Confess, and you will suffer less pain.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I didn’t know what she was talking about. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">All I could think of was that the teachers must’ve found the illegal stash of
                        candy I’d been
                        selling out of my dorm room. Or maybe they’d realized I got my essay on <em class="calibre5">Tom
                            Sawyer
                        </em>from the Internet without ever reading the book and now they were going to take away my
                        grade. Or worse,
                        they were going to make me read the book. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Well?” she demanded. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Ma’am, I don’t…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Your time is up,” she hissed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then the weirdest thing happened. Her eyes began to glow like barbecue coals.
                        Her fingers
                        stretched, turning into talons. Her jacket melted into large, leathery wings. She wasn’t human.
                        She was a
                        shriveled hag with bat wings and claws and a mouth full of yellow fangs, and she was about to
                        slice me to
                        ribbons. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then things got even stranger. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Mr. Brunner, who’d been out in front of the museum a minute before, wheeled his
                        chair into the
                        doorway of the gallery, holding a pen in his hand. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What ho, Percy!” he shouted, and tossed the pen through the air. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Mrs. Dodds lunged at me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">With a yelp, I dodged and felt talons slash the air next to my ear. I snatched
                        the ballpoint
                        pen out of the air, but when it hit my hand, it wasn’t a pen anymore. It was a sword—Mr.
                        Brunner’s bronze sword,
                        which he always used on tournament day. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Mrs. Dodds spun toward me with a murderous look in her eyes. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My knees were jelly. My hands were shaking so bad I almost dropped the sword.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She snarled, “Die, honey!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">And she flew straight at me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Absolute terror ran through my body. I did the only thing that came naturally:
                        I swung the
                        sword. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The metal blade hit her shoulder and passed clean through her body as if she
                        were made of
                        water. <em class="calibre5">Hisss! </em></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Mrs. Dodds was a sand castle in a power fan. She exploded into yellow powder,
                        vaporized on the
                        spot, leaving nothing but the smell of sulfur and a dying screech and a chill of evil in the
                        air, as if those
                        two glowing red eyes were still watching me. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img" src="../assets/images/scenes/1-4.png" alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">I was alone. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">There was a ballpoint pen in my hand. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Mr. Brunner wasn’t there. Nobody was there but me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My hands were still trembling. My lunch must’ve been contaminated with magic
                        mushrooms or
                        something. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Had I imagined the whole thing? </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I went back outside. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It had started to rain. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover was sitting by the fountain, a museum map tented over his head. Nancy
                        Bobofit was still
                        standing there, soaked from her swim in the fountain, grumbling to her ugly friends. When she
                        saw me, she said,
                        “I hope Mrs. Kerr whipped your butt.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I said, “Who?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Our <em class="calibre5">teacher</em>. Duh!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I blinked. We had no teacher named Mrs. Kerr. I asked Nancy what she was
                        talking about. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She just rolled her eyes and turned away. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I asked Grover where Mrs. Dodds was. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He said, “Who?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">But he paused first, and he wouldn’t look at me, so I thought he was messing
                        with me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Not funny, man,” I told him. “This is serious.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Thunder boomed overhead. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I saw Mr. Brunner sitting under his red umbrella, reading his book, as if he’d
                        never moved.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I went over to him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He looked up, a little distracted. “Ah, that would be my pen. Please bring your
                        own writing
                        utensil in the future, Mr. Jackson.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I handed Mr. Brunner his pen. I hadn’t even realized I was still holding it.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Sir,” I said, “where’s Mrs. Dodds?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He stared at me blankly. “Who?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The other chaperone. Mrs. Dodds. The pre-algebra teacher.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He frowned and sat forward, looking mildly concerned. “Percy, there is no Mrs.
                        Dodds on this
                        trip. As far as I know, there has never been a Mrs. Dodds at Yancy Academy. Are you feeling all
                        right?” </p>

                    <p class="calibre13"><span class="bigcap">I</span> was used to the occasional weird experience, but
                        usually they
                        were over quickly. This twenty-four/seven hallucination was more than I could handle. For the
                        rest of the school
                        year, the entire campus seemed to be playing some kind of trick on me. The students acted as if
                        they were
                        completely and totally convinced that Mrs. Kerr—a perky blond woman whom I’d never seen in my
                        life until she got
                        on our bus at the end of the field trip—had been our pre-algebra teacher since Christmas. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Every so often I would spring a Mrs. Dodds reference on somebody, just to see
                        if I could trip
                        them up, but they would stare at me like I was psycho. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It got so I almost believed them—Mrs. Dodds had never existed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Almost. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">But Grover couldn’t fool me. When I mentioned the name Dodds to him, he would
                        hesitate, then
                        claim she didn’t exist. But I knew he was lying. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Something was going on. Something <em class="calibre5">had </em>happened at the
                        museum. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I didn’t have much time to think about it during the days, but at night,
                        visions of Mrs. Dodds
                        with talons and leathery wings would wake me up in a cold sweat. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The freak weather continued, which didn’t help my mood. One night, a
                        thunderstorm blew out the
                        windows in my dorm room. A few days later, the biggest tornado ever spotted in the Hudson Valley
                        touched down
                        only fifty miles from Yancy Academy. One of the current events we studied in social studies
                        class was the
                        unusual number of small planes that had gone down in sudden squalls in the Atlantic that year.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I started feeling cranky and irritable most of the time. My grades slipped from
                        Ds to Fs. I got
                        into more fights with Nancy Bobofit and her friends. I was sent out into the hallway in almost
                        every class. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Finally, when our English teacher, Mr. Nicoll, asked me for the millionth time
                        why I was too
                        lazy to study for spelling tests, I snapped. I called him an old sot. I wasn’t even sure what it
                        meant, but it
                        sounded good. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The headmaster sent my mom a letter the following week, making it official: I
                        would not be
                        invited back next year to Yancy Academy. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Fine, I told myself. Just fine. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I was homesick. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I wanted to be with my mom in our little apartment on the Upper East Side, even
                        if I had to go
                        to public school and put up with my obnoxious stepfather and his stupid poker parties. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">And yet…there were things I’d miss at Yancy. The view of the woods out my dorm
                        window, the
                        Hudson River in the distance, the smell of pine trees. I’d miss Grover, who’d been a good
                        friend, even if he was
                        a little strange. I worried how he’d survive next year without me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I’d miss Latin class, too—Mr. Brunner’s crazy tournament days and his faith
                        that I could do
                        well. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">As exam week got closer, Latin was the only test I studied for. I hadn’t
                        forgotten what Mr.
                        Brunner had told me about this subject being life-and-death for me. I wasn’t sure why, but I’d
                        started to
                        believe him. </p>

                    <p class="calibre13">The evening before my final, I got so frustrated I threw the <em

                        circling my
                        head, the letters doing one-eighties as if they were riding skateboards. There was no way I was
                        going to
                        remember the difference between Chiron and Charon, or Polydictes and Polydeuces. And conjugating
                        those Latin
                        verbs? Forget it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I paced the room, feeling like ants were crawling around inside my shirt. </p>

                    <p class="calibre14">I took a deep breath. I picked up the mythology book. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I’d never asked a teacher for help before. Maybe if I talked to Mr. Brunner, he
                        could give me
                        some pointers. At least I could apologize for the big fat F I was about to score on his exam. I
                        didn’t want to
                        leave Yancy Academy with him thinking I hadn’t tried. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I walked downstairs to the faculty offices. Most of them were dark and empty,
                        but Mr. Brunner’s
                        door was ajar, light from his window stretching across the hallway floor. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I was three steps from the door handle when I heard voices inside the office.
                        Mr. Brunner asked
                        a question. A voice that was definitely Grover’s said “…worried about Percy, sir.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I froze. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I’m not usually an eavesdropper, but I dare you to try not listening if you

                            class="calibre5">school</em>! Now that we know for sure, and <em class="calibre5">they
                        </em>know too—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We would only make matters worse by rushing him,” Mr. Brunner said. “We need
                        the boy to mature
                        more.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But he may not have time. The summer solstice deadline—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Will have to be resolved without him, Grover. Let him enjoy his ignorance
                        while he still can.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Sir, he <em class="calibre5">saw </em>her.…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“His imagination,” Mr. Brunner insisted. “The Mist over the students and staff
                        will be enough
                        to convince him of that.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Sir, I…I can’t fail in my duties again.” Grover’s voice was choked with
                        emotion. “You know
                        what that would mean.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You haven’t failed, Grover,” Mr. Brunner said kindly. “I should have seen her
                        for what she
                        was. Now let’s just worry about keeping Percy alive until next fall—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The mythology book dropped out of my hand and hit the floor with a thud. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Mr. Brunner went silent. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My heart hammering, I picked up the book and backed down the hall. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A shadow slid across the lighted glass of Brunner’s office door, the shadow of
                        something much
                        taller than my wheelchair-bound teacher, holding something that looked suspiciously like an
                        archer’s bow. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img" src="../assets/images/scenes/2-1.png" alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">I opened the nearest door and slipped inside. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A few seconds later I heard a slow <em class="calibre5">clop-clop-clop</em>,
                        like muffled wood
                        blocks, then a sound like an animal snuffling right outside my door. A large, dark shape paused
                        in front of the
                        glass, then moved on. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A bead of sweat trickled down my neck. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Somewhere in the hallway, Mr. Brunner spoke. “Nothing,” he murmured. “My nerves
                        haven’t been
                        right since the winter solstice.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Mine neither,” Grover said. “But I could have sworn…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Go back to the dorm,” Mr. Brunner told him. “You’ve got a long day of exams
                        tomorrow.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Don’t remind me.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The lights went out in Mr. Brunner’s office. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I waited in the dark for what seemed like forever. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Finally, I slipped out into the hallway and made my way back up to the dorm.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover was lying on his bed, studying his Latin exam notes like he’d been there
                        all night. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hey,” he said, bleary-eyed. “You going to be ready for this test?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I didn’t answer. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You look awful.” He frowned. “Is everything okay?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Just…tired.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I turned so he couldn’t read my expression, and started getting ready for bed.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I didn’t understand what I’d heard downstairs. I wanted to believe I’d imagined
                        the whole
                        thing. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">But one thing was clear: Grover and Mr. Brunner were talking about me behind my
                        back. They
                        thought I was in some kind of danger. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">The next afternoon, as I was leaving the three-hour Latin exam, my eyes
                        swimming with all the
                        Greek and Roman names I’d misspelled, Mr. Brunner called me back inside. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">For a moment, I was worried he’d found out about my eavesdropping the night
                        before, but that
                        didn’t seem to be the problem. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy,” he said. “Don’t be discouraged about leaving Yancy. It’s…it’s for the
                        best.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">His tone was kind, but the words still embarrassed me. Even though he was
                        speaking quietly, the
                        other kids finishing the test could hear. Nancy Bobofit smirked at me and made sarcastic little
                        kissing motions
                        with her lips. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I mumbled, “Okay, sir.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I mean…” Mr. Brunner wheeled his chair back and forth, like he wasn’t sure
                        what to say. “This
                        isn’t the right place for you. It was only a matter of time.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My eyes stung. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Here was my favorite teacher, in front of the class, telling me I couldn’t
                        handle it. After
                        saying he believed in me all year, now he was telling me I was destined to get kicked out. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Right,” I said, trembling. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No, no,” Mr. Brunner said. “Oh, confound it all. What I’m trying to say…you’re
                        not normal,
                        Percy. That’s nothing to be—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Thanks,” I blurted. “Thanks a lot, sir, for reminding me.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">But I was already gone. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">On the last day of the term, I shoved my clothes into my suitcase. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The other guys were joking around, talking about their vacation plans. One of
                        them was going on
                        a hiking trip to Switzerland. Another was cruising the Caribbean for a month. They were juvenile
                        delinquents,
                        like me, but they were <em class="calibre5">rich </em>juvenile delinquents. Their daddies were
                        executives, or
                        ambassadors, or celebrities. I was a nobody, from a family of nobodies. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">They asked me what I’d be doing this summer and I told them I was going back to
                        the city. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">What I didn’t tell them was that I’d have to get a summer job walking dogs or
                        selling magazine
                        subscriptions, and spend my free time worrying about where I’d go to school in the fall. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh,” one of the guys said. “That’s cool.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">They went back to their conversation as if I’d never existed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The only person I dreaded saying good-bye to was Grover, but as it turned out,
                        I didn’t have
                        to. He’d booked a ticket to Manhattan on the same Greyhound as I had, so there we were, together
                        again, heading
                        into the city. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">During the whole bus ride, Grover kept glancing nervously down the aisle,
                        watching the other
                        passengers. It occurred to me that he’d always acted nervous and fidgety when we left Yancy, as
                        if he expected
                        something bad to happen. Before, I’d always assumed he was worried about getting teased. But
                        there was nobody to
                        tease him on the Greyhound. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Finally I couldn’t stand it anymore. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I said, “Looking for Kindly Ones?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover nearly jumped out of his seat. “Wha—what do you mean?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I confessed about eavesdropping on him and Mr. Brunner the night before the
                        exam. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover’s eye twitched. “How much did you hear?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh…not much. What’s the summer solstice deadline?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He winced. “Look, Percy…I was just worried for you, see? I mean, hallucinating
                        about demon math
                        teachers…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Grover—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“And I was telling Mr. Brunner that maybe you were overstressed or something,
                        because there was
                        no such person as Mrs. Dodds, and…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Grover, you’re a really, really bad liar.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">His ears turned pink. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img" src="../assets/images/scenes/2-2.png" alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">From his shirt pocket, he fished out a grubby business card. “Just take this,
                        okay? In case you
                        need me this summer.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The card was in fancy script, which was murder on my dyslexic eyes, but I
                        finally made out
                        something like: </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"> </p>
                    <p class="center6"><em class="calibre5"><b class="calibre16">Grover Underwood</b><br
                                class="calibre1" />Keeper</em>
                    </p>
                    <p class="center"><em class="calibre5">Half-Blood Hill<br class="calibre1" />Long Island, New
                            York<br class="calibre1" />(800) 009-0009</em></p>
                    <p class="calibre14"> </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What’s Half—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Don’t say it aloud!” he yelped. “That’s my, um…summer address.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My heart sank. Grover had a summer home. I’d never considered that his family
                        might be as rich
                        as the others at Yancy. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Okay,” I said glumly. “So, like, if I want to come visit your mansion.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He nodded. “Or…or if you need me.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Why would I need you?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It came out harsher than I meant it to. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover blushed right down to his Adam’s apple. “Look, Percy, the truth is, I—I
                        kind of have to
                        protect you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stared at him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">All year long, I’d gotten in fights, keeping bullies away from him. I’d lost
                        sleep worrying
                        that he’d get beaten up next year without me. And here he was acting like he was the one who
                        defended <em class="calibre5">me</em>. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Grover,” I said, “what exactly are you protecting me from?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">There was a huge grinding noise under our feet. Black smoke poured from the
                        dashboard and the
                        whole bus filled with a smell like rotten eggs. The driver cursed and limped the Greyhound over
                        to the side of
                        the highway. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">After a few minutes clanking around in the engine compartment, the driver
                        announced that we’d
                        all have to get off. Grover and I filed outside with everybody else. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We were on a stretch of country road—no place you’d notice if you didn’t break
                        down there. On
                        our side of the highway was nothing but maple trees and litter from passing cars. On the other
                        side, across four
                        lanes of asphalt shimmering with afternoon heat, was an old-fashioned fruit stand. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The stuff on sale looked really good: heaping boxes of bloodred cherries and
                        apples, walnuts
                        and apricots, jugs of cider in a claw-foot tub full of ice. There were no customers, just three
                        old ladies
                        sitting in rocking chairs in the shade of a maple tree, knitting the biggest pair of socks I’d
                        ever seen. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I mean these socks were the size of sweaters, but they were clearly socks. The
                        lady on the
                        right knitted one of them. The lady on the left knitted the other. The lady in the middle held
                        an enormous
                        basket of electric-blue yarn. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">All three women looked ancient, with pale faces wrinkled like fruit leather,
                        silver hair tied
                        back in white bandannas, bony arms sticking out of bleached cotton dresses. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The weirdest thing was, they seemed to be looking right at me. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img" src="../assets/images/scenes/2-3.png" alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">I looked over at Grover to say something about this and saw that the blood had
                        drained from his
                        face. His nose was twitching. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Grover?” I said. “Hey, man—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Tell me they’re not looking at you. They are, aren’t they?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah. Weird, huh? You think those socks would fit me?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Not funny, Percy. Not funny at all.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The old lady in the middle took out a huge pair of scissors—gold and silver,
                        long-bladed, like
                        shears. I heard Grover catch his breath. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We’re getting on the bus,” he told me. “Come on.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What?” I said. “It’s a thousand degrees in there.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Come on!” He pried open the door and climbed inside, but I stayed back. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Across the road, the old ladies were still watching me. The middle one cut the
                        yarn, and I
                        swear I could hear that <em class="calibre5">snip </em>across four lanes of traffic. Her two
                        friends balled up
                        the electric-blue socks, leaving me wondering who they could possibly be for—Sasquatch or
                        Godzilla. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">At the rear of the bus, the driver wrenched a big chunk of smoking metal out of
                        the engine
                        compartment. The bus shuddered, and the engine roared back to life. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The passengers cheered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Darn right!” yelled the driver. He slapped the bus with his hat. “Everybody
                        back on board!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Once we got going, I started feeling feverish, as if I’d caught the flu. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover didn’t look much better. He was shivering and his teeth were chattering.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Grover?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What are you not telling me?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He dabbed his forehead with his shirt sleeve. “Percy, what did you see back at
                        the fruit
                        stand?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You mean the old ladies? What is it about them, man? They’re not like…Mrs.
                        Dodds, are they?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">His expression was hard to read, but I got the feeling that the fruit-stand
                        ladies were
                        something much, much worse than Mrs. Dodds. He said, “Just tell me what you saw.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The middle one took out her scissors, and she cut the yarn.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He closed his eyes and made a gesture with his fingers that might’ve been
                        crossing himself, but
                        it wasn’t. It was something else, something almost—older. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He said, “You saw her snip the cord.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah. So?” But even as I said it, I knew it was a big deal. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“This is not happening,” Grover mumbled. He started chewing at his thumb. “I
                        don’t want this to
                        be like the last time.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What last time?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Always sixth grade. They never get past sixth.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Grover,” I said, because he was really starting to scare me. “What are you
                        talking about?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Let me walk you home from the bus station. Promise me.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">This seemed like a strange request to me, but I promised he could. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Is this like a superstition or something?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">No answer. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Grover—that snipping of the yarn. Does that mean somebody is going to die?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He looked at me mournfully, like he was already picking the kind of flowers I’d
                        like best on my
                        coffin. </p>

                    <p class="calibre13"><span class="bigcap">C</span>onfession time: I ditched Grover as soon as we got
                        to the bus
                        terminal. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I know, I know. It was rude. But Grover was freaking me out, looking at me like
                        I was a dead
                        man, muttering “Why does this always happen?” and “Why does it always have to be sixth grade?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Whenever he got upset, Grover’s bladder acted up, so I wasn’t surprised when,
                        as soon as we got
                        off the bus, he made me promise to wait for him, then made a beeline for the restroom. Instead
                        of waiting, I got
                        my suitcase, slipped outside, and caught the first taxi uptown. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“East One-hundred-and-fourth and First,” I told the driver. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">A word about my mother, before you meet her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Her name is Sally Jackson and she’s the best person in the world, which just
                        proves my theory
                        that the best people have the rottenest luck. Her own parents died in a plane crash when she was
                        five, and she
                        was raised by an uncle who didn’t care much about her. She wanted to be a novelist, so she spent
                        high school
                        working to save enough money for a college with a good creative-writing program. Then her uncle
                        got cancer, and
                        she had to quit school her senior year to take care of him. After he died, she was left with no
                        money, no
                        family, and no diploma. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The only good break she ever got was meeting my dad. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I don’t have any memories of him, just this sort of warm glow, maybe the barest
                        trace of his
                        smile. My mom doesn’t like to talk about him because it makes her sad. She has no pictures. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">See, they weren’t married. She told me he was rich and important, and their
                        relationship was a
                        secret. Then one day, he set sail across the Atlantic on some important journey, and he never
                        came back. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Lost at sea, my mom told me. Not dead. Lost at sea. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She worked odd jobs, took night classes to get her high school diploma, and
                        raised me on her
                        own. She never complained or got mad. Not even once. But I knew I wasn’t an easy kid. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Finally, she married Gabe Ugliano, who was nice the first thirty seconds we
                        knew him, then
                        showed his true colors as a world-class jerk. When I was young, I nicknamed him Smelly Gabe. I’m
                        sorry, but it’s
                        the truth. The guy reeked like moldy garlic pizza wrapped in gym shorts. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Between the two of us, we made my mom’s life pretty hard. The way Smelly Gabe
                        treated her, the
                        way he and I got along…well, when I came home is a good example. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">I walked into our little apartment, hoping my mom would be home from work.
                        Instead, Smelly Gabe
                        was in the living room, playing poker with his buddies. The television blared ESPN. Chips and
                        beer cans were
                        strewn all over the carpet. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Hardly looking up, he said around his cigar, “So, you’re home.” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img" src="../assets/images/scenes/3-1.png" alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“Where’s my mom?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Working,” he said. “You got any cash?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">That was it. No <em class="calibre5">Welcome back. Good to see you. How has
                            your life been the
                            last six months? </em></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Gabe had put on weight. He looked like a tuskless walrus in thrift-store
                        clothes. He had about
                        three hairs on his head, all combed over his bald scalp, as if that made him handsome or
                        something. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He managed the Electronics Mega-Mart in Queens, but he stayed home most of the
                        time. I don’t
                        know why he hadn’t been fired long before. He just kept on collecting paychecks, spending the
                        money on cigars
                        that made me nauseous, and on beer, of course. Always beer. Whenever I was home, he expected me
                        to provide his
                        gambling funds. He called that our “guy secret.” Meaning, if I told my mom, he would punch my
                        lights out. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I don’t have any cash,” I told him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He raised a greasy eyebrow. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Gabe could sniff out money like a bloodhound, which was surprising, since his
                        own smell
                        should’ve covered up everything else. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You took a taxi from the bus station,” he said. “Probably paid with a twenty.
                        Got six, seven
                        bucks in change. Somebody expects to live under this roof, he ought to carry his own weight. Am
                        I right, Eddie?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Eddie, the super of the apartment building, looked at me with a twinge of
                        sympathy. “Come on,
                        Gabe,” he said. “The kid just got here.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Am I <em class="calibre5">right</em>?” Gabe repeated. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Eddie scowled into his bowl of pretzels. The other two guys passed gas in
                        harmony. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Fine,” I said. I dug a wad of dollars out of my pocket and threw the money on
                        the table. “I
                        hope you lose.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Your report card came, brain boy!” he shouted after me. “I wouldn’t act so
                        snooty!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I slammed the door to my room, which really wasn’t my room. During school
                        months, it was Gabe’s
                        “study.” He didn’t study anything in there except old car magazines, but he loved shoving my
                        stuff in the
                        closet, leaving his muddy boots on my windowsill, and doing his best to make the place smell
                        like his nasty
                        cologne and cigars and stale beer. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I dropped my suitcase on the bed. Home sweet home. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Gabe’s smell was almost worse than the nightmares about Mrs. Dodds, or the
                        sound of that old
                        fruit lady’s shears snipping the yarn. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">But as soon as I thought that, my legs felt weak. I remembered Grover’s look of
                        panic—how he’d
                        made me promise I wouldn’t go home without him. A sudden chill rolled through me. I felt like
                        someone—something—was looking for me right now, maybe pounding its way up the stairs, growing
                        long, horrible
                        talons. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then I heard my mom’s voice. “Percy?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She opened the bedroom door, and my fears melted. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My mother can make me feel good just by walking into the room. Her eyes sparkle
                        and change
                        color in the light. Her smile is as warm as a quilt. She’s got a few gray streaks mixed in with
                        her long brown
                        hair, but I never think of her as old. When she looks at me, it’s like she’s seeing all the good
                        things about
                        me, none of the bad. I’ve never heard her raise her voice or say an unkind word to anyone, not
                        even me or Gabe.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, Percy.” She hugged me tight. “I can’t believe it. You’ve grown since
                        Christmas!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Her red-white-and-blue Sweet on America uniform smelled like the best things in
                        the world:
                        chocolate, licorice, and all the other stuff she sold at the candy shop in Grand Central. She’d
                        brought me a
                        huge bag of “free samples,” the way she always did when I came home. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img" src="../assets/images/scenes/3-2.png" alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">We sat together on the edge of the bed. While I attacked the blueberry sour
                        strings, she ran
                        her hand through my hair and demanded to know everything I hadn’t put in my letters. She didn’t
                        mention anything
                        about my getting expelled. She didn’t seem to care about that. But was I okay? Was her little
                        boy doing all
                        right? </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I told her she was smothering me, and to lay off and all that, but secretly, I
                        was really,
                        really glad to see her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">From the other room, Gabe yelled, “Hey, Sally—how about some bean dip, huh?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I gritted my teeth. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My mom is the nicest lady in the world. She should’ve been married to a
                        millionaire, not to
                        some jerk like Gabe. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">For her sake, I tried to sound upbeat about my last days at Yancy Academy. I
                        told her I wasn’t
                        too down about the expulsion. I’d lasted almost the whole year this time. I’d made some new
                        friends. I’d done
                        pretty well in Latin. And honestly, the fights hadn’t been as bad as the headmaster said. I
                        liked Yancy Academy.
                        I really did. I put such a good spin on the year, I almost convinced myself. I started choking
                        up, thinking
                        about Grover and Mr. Brunner. Even Nancy Bobofit suddenly didn’t seem so bad. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Until that trip to the museum…</p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What?” my mom asked. Her eyes tugged at my conscience, trying to pull out the
                        secrets. “Did
                        something scare you?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No, Mom.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I felt bad lying. I wanted to tell her about Mrs. Dodds and the three old
                        ladies with the yarn,
                        but I thought it would sound stupid. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She pursed her lips. She knew I was holding back, but she didn’t push me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I have a surprise for you,” she said. “We’re going to the beach.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My eyes widened. “Montauk?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Three nights—same cabin.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“When?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She smiled. “As soon as I get changed.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I couldn’t believe it. My mom and I hadn’t been to Montauk the last two
                        summers, because Gabe
                        said there wasn’t enough money. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Gabe appeared in the doorway and growled, “Bean dip, Sally? Didn’t you hear
                        me?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I wanted to punch him, but I met my mom’s eyes and I understood she was
                        offering me a deal: be
                        nice to Gabe for a little while. Just until she was ready to leave for Montauk. Then we would
                        get out of here.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I was on my way, honey,” she told Gabe. “We were just talking about the trip.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Gabe’s eyes got small. “The trip? You mean you were serious about that?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I knew it,” I muttered. “He won’t let us go.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Of course he will,” my mom said evenly. “Your stepfather is just worried about
                        money. That’s
                        all. Besides,” she added, “Gabriel won’t have to settle for bean dip. I’ll make him enough
                        seven-layer dip for
                        the whole weekend. Guacamole. Sour cream. The works.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Gabe softened a bit. “So this money for your trip…it comes out of your clothes
                        budget, right?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yes, honey,” my mother said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“And you won’t take my car anywhere but there and back.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We’ll be very careful.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Gabe scratched his double chin. “Maybe if you hurry with that seven-layer
                        dip…And maybe if the
                        kid apologizes for interrupting my poker game.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Maybe if I kick you in your soft spot, I thought. And make you sing soprano for
                        a week. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">But my mom’s eyes warned me not to make him mad. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Why did she put up with this guy? I wanted to scream. Why did she care what he
                        thought? </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m sorry,” I muttered. “I’m really sorry I interrupted your incredibly
                        important poker game.
                        Please go back to it right now.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Gabe’s eyes narrowed. His tiny brain was probably trying to detect sarcasm in
                        my statement.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah, whatever,” he decided. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He went back to his game. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Thank you, Percy,” my mom said. “Once we get to Montauk, we’ll talk more
                        about…whatever you’ve
                        forgotten to tell me, okay?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">For a moment, I thought I saw anxiety in her eyes—the same fear I’d seen in
                        Grover during the
                        bus ride—as if my mom too felt an odd chill in the air. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">But then her smile returned, and I figured I must have been mistaken. She
                        ruffled my hair and
                        went to make Gabe his seven-layer dip. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">An hour later we were ready to leave. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Gabe took a break from his poker game long enough to watch me lug my mom’s bags
                        to the car. He
                        kept griping and groaning about losing her cooking—and more important, his ’78 Camaro—for the
                        whole weekend.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Not a scratch on this car, brain boy,” he warned me as I loaded the last bag.
                        “Not one little
                        scratch.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Like I’d be the one driving. I was twelve. But that didn’t matter to Gabe. If a
                        seagull so much
                        as pooped on his paint job, he’d find a way to blame me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Watching him lumber back toward the apartment building, I got so mad I did
                        something I can’t
                        explain. As Gabe reached the doorway, I made the hand gesture I’d seen Grover make on the bus, a
                        sort of
                        warding-off-evil gesture, a clawed hand over my heart, then a shoving movement toward Gabe. The
                        screen door
                        slammed shut so hard it whacked him in the butt and sent him flying up the staircase as if he’d
                        been shot from a
                        cannon. Maybe it was just the wind, or some freak accident with the hinges, but I didn’t stay
                        long enough to
                        find out. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I got in the Camaro and told my mom to step on it. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">Our rental cabin was on the south shore, way out at the tip of Long Island. It
                        was a little
                        pastel box with faded curtains, half sunken into the dunes. There was always sand in the sheets
                        and spiders in
                        the cabinets, and most of the time the sea was too cold to swim in. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I loved the place. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We’d been going there since I was a baby. My mom had been going even longer.
                        She never exactly
                        said, but I knew why the beach was special to her. It was the place where she’d met my dad. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">As we got closer to Montauk, she seemed to grow younger, years of worry and
                        work disappearing
                        from her face. Her eyes turned the color of the sea. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img" src="../assets/images/scenes/3-3.png" alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">We got there at sunset, opened all the cabin’s windows, and went through our
                        usual cleaning
                        routine. We walked on the beach, fed blue corn chips to the seagulls, and munched on blue jelly
                        beans, blue
                        saltwater taffy, and all the other free samples my mom had brought from work. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I guess I should explain the blue food. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">See, Gabe had once told my mom there was no such thing. They had this fight,
                        which seemed like
                        a really small thing at the time. But ever since, my mom went out of her way to eat blue. She
                        baked blue
                        birthday cakes. She mixed blueberry smoothies. She bought blue-corn tortilla chips and brought
                        home blue candy
                        from the shop. This—along with keeping her maiden name, Jackson, rather than calling herself
                        Mrs. Ugliano—was
                        proof that she wasn’t totally suckered by Gabe. She did have a rebellious streak, like me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">When it got dark, we made a fire. We roasted hot dogs and marshmallows. Mom
                        told me stories
                        about when she was a kid, back before her parents died in the plane crash. She told me about the
                        books she
                        wanted to write someday, when she had enough money to quit the candy shop. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Eventually, I got up the nerve to ask about what was always on my mind whenever
                        we came to
                        Montauk—my father. Mom’s eyes went all misty. I figured she would tell me the same things she
                        always did, but I
                        never got tired of hearing them. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“He was kind, Percy,” she said. “Tall, handsome, and powerful. But gentle, too.
                        You have his
                        black hair, you know, and his green eyes.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Mom fished a blue jelly bean out of her candy bag. “I wish he could see you,
                        Percy. He would be
                        so proud.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I wondered how she could say that. What was so great about me? A dyslexic,
                        hyperactive boy with
                        a D+ report card, kicked out of school for the sixth time in six years. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“How old was I?” I asked. “I mean…when he left?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She watched the flames. “He was only with me for one summer, Percy. Right here
                        at this beach.
                        This cabin.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But…he knew me as a baby.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No, honey. He knew I was expecting a baby, but he never saw you. He had to
                        leave before you
                        were born.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I tried to square that with the fact that I seemed to remember…something about
                        my father. A
                        warm glow. A smile. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I had always assumed he knew me as a baby. My mom had never said it outright,
                        but still, I’d
                        felt it must be true. Now, to be told that he’d never even seen me…</p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I felt angry at my father. Maybe it was stupid, but I resented him for going on
                        that ocean
                        voyage, for not having the guts to marry my mom. He’d left us, and now we were stuck with Smelly
                        Gabe. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Are you going to send me away again?” I asked her. “To another boarding
                        school?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She pulled a marshmallow from the fire. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I don’t know, honey.” Her voice was heavy. “I think…I think we’ll have to do
                        something.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Because you don’t want me around?” I regretted the words as soon as they were
                        out. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My mom’s eyes welled with tears. She took my hand, squeezed it tight. “Oh,
                        Percy, no. I—I <em class="calibre5">have </em>to, honey. For your own good. I have to send you
                        away.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Her words reminded me of what Mr. Brunner had said—that it was best for me to
                        leave Yancy. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Because I’m not normal,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You say that as if it’s a bad thing, Percy. But you don’t realize how
                        important you are. I
                        thought Yancy Academy would be far enough away. I thought you’d finally be safe.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Safe from what?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She met my eyes, and a flood of memories came back to me—all the weird, scary
                        things that had
                        ever happened to me, some of which I’d tried to forget. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">During third grade, a man in a black trench coat had stalked me on the
                        playground. When the
                        teachers threatened to call the police, he went away growling, but no one believed me when I
                        told them that
                        under his broad-brimmed hat, the man only had one eye, right in the middle of his head. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Before that—a really early memory. I was in preschool, and a teacher
                        accidentally put me down
                        for a nap in a cot that a snake had slithered into. My mom screamed when she came to pick me up
                        and found me
                        playing with a limp, scaly rope I’d somehow managed to strangle to death with my meaty toddler
                        hands. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">In every single school, something creepy had happened, something unsafe, and I
                        was forced to
                        move. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I knew I should tell my mom about the old ladies at the fruit stand, and Mrs.
                        Dodds at the art
                        museum, about my weird hallucination that I had sliced my math teacher into dust with a sword.
                        But I couldn’t
                        make myself tell her. I had a strange feeling the news would end our trip to Montauk, and I
                        didn’t want that.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’ve tried to keep you as close to me as I could,” my mom said. “They told me
                        that was a
                        mistake. But there’s only one other option, Percy—the place your father wanted to send you. And
                        I just…I just
                        can’t stand to do it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“My father wanted me to go to a special school?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Not a school,” she said softly. “A summer camp.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My head was spinning. Why would my dad—who hadn’t even stayed around long
                        enough to see me
                        born—talk to my mom about a summer camp? And if it was so important, why hadn’t she ever
                        mentioned it before?
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m sorry, Percy,” she said, seeing the look in my eyes. “But I can’t talk
                        about it. I—I
                        couldn’t send you to that place. It might mean saying good-bye to you for good.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“For good? But if it’s only a summer camp…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She turned toward the fire, and I knew from her expression that if I asked her
                        any more
                        questions she would start to cry. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">That night I had a vivid dream. It was storming on the beach, and two beautiful
                        animals, a
                        white horse and a golden eagle, were trying to kill each other at the edge of the surf. The
                        eagle swooped down
                        and slashed the horse’s muzzle with its huge talons. The horse reared up and kicked at the
                        eagle’s wings. As
                        they fought, the ground rumbled, and a monstrous voice chuckled somewhere beneath the earth,
                        goading the animals
                        to fight harder. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I ran toward them, knowing I had to stop them from killing each other, but I
                        was running in
                        slow motion. I knew I would be too late. I saw the eagle dive down, its beak aimed at the
                        horse’s wide eyes, and
                        I screamed, <em class="calibre5">No! </em></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I woke with a start. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Outside, it really was storming, the kind of storm that cracks trees and blows
                        down houses.
                        There was no horse or eagle on the beach, just lightning making false daylight, and twenty-foot
                        waves pounding
                        the dunes like artillery. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">With the next thunderclap, my mom woke. She sat up, eyes wide, and said,
                        “Hurricane.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I knew that was crazy. Long Island never sees hurricanes this early in the
                        summer. But the
                        ocean seemed to have forgotten. Over the roar of the wind, I heard a distant bellow, an angry,
                        tortured sound
                        that made my hair stand on end. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then a much closer noise, like mallets in the sand. A desperate voice—someone
                        yelling, pounding
                        on our cabin door. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My mother sprang out of bed in her nightgown and threw open the lock. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover stood framed in the doorway against a backdrop of pouring rain. But he
                        wasn’t…he wasn’t
                        exactly Grover. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Searching all night,” he gasped. “What were you thinking?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My mother looked at me in terror—not scared of Grover, but of why he’d come.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy,” she said, shouting to be heard over the rain. “What happened at
                        school? What didn’t
                        you tell me?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I was frozen, looking at Grover. I couldn’t understand what I was seeing. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img" src="../assets/images/scenes/3-4.png" alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14"><em class="calibre5">“O Zeu kai alloi theoi!” </em>he yelled. “It’s right
                        behind me! Didn’t you
                        <em class="calibre5">tell </em>her?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I was too shocked to register that he’d just cursed in Ancient Greek, and I’d
                        understood him
                        perfectly. I was too shocked to wonder how Grover had gotten here by himself in the middle of
                        the night. Because
                        Grover didn’t have his pants on—and where his legs should be…where his legs should be…</p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My mom looked at me sternly and talked in a tone she’d never used before: “<em
                            class="calibre5">Percy. </em>Tell me <em class="calibre5">now</em>!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stammered something about the old ladies at the fruit stand, and Mrs. Dodds,
                        and my mom
                        stared at me, her face deathly pale in the flashes of lightning. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She grabbed her purse, tossed me my rain jacket, and said, “Get to the car.
                        Both of you. <em class="calibre5">Go</em>!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover ran for the Camaro—but he wasn’t running, exactly. He was trotting,
                        shaking his shaggy
                        hindquarters, and suddenly his story about a muscular disorder in his legs made sense to me. I
                        understood how he
                        could run so fast and still limp when he walked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Because where his feet should be, there were no feet. There were cloven hooves.

                    <p class="calibre13"><span class="bigcap">W</span>e tore through the night along dark country roads.
                        Wind slammed
                        against the Camaro. Rain lashed the windshield. I didn’t know how my mom could see anything, but
                        she kept her
                        foot on the gas. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Every time there was a flash of lightning, I looked at Grover sitting next to
                        me in the
                        backseat and I wondered if I’d gone insane, or if he was wearing some kind of shag-carpet pants.
                        But, no, the
                        smell was one I remembered from kindergarten field trips to the petting zoo—lanolin, like from
                        wool. The smell
                        of a wet barnyard animal. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">All I could think to say was, “So, you and my mom…know each other?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover’s eyes flitted to the rearview mirror, though there were no cars behind
                        us. “Not
                        exactly,” he said. “I mean, we’ve never met in person. But she knew I was watching you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Watching me?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Keeping tabs on you. Making sure you were okay. But I wasn’t faking being your
                        friend,” he
                        added hastily. “I <em class="calibre5">am </em>your friend.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Um…what <em class="calibre5">are </em>you, exactly?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“That doesn’t matter right now.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It doesn’t matter? From the waist down, my best friend is a donkey—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover let out a sharp, throaty <em class="calibre5">“Blaa-ha-ha!” </em></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I’d heard him make that sound before, but I’d always assumed it was a nervous
                        laugh. Now I
                        realized it was more of an irritated bleat. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Goat!” he cried. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m a <em class="calibre5">goat </em>from the waist down.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You just said it didn’t matter.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><em class="calibre5">“Blaa-ha-ha! </em>There are satyrs who would trample you
                        underhoof for
                        such an insult!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Whoa. Wait. Satyrs. You mean like…Mr. Brunner’s myths?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Were those old ladies at the fruit stand a <em class="calibre5">myth</em>,
                        Percy? Was Mrs.
                        Dodds a myth?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“So you <em class="calibre5">admit </em>there was a Mrs. Dodds!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Of course.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Then why—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The less you knew, the fewer monsters you’d attract,” Grover said, like that
                        should be
                        perfectly obvious. “We put Mist over the humans’ eyes. We hoped you’d think the Kindly One was a
                        hallucination.
                        But it was no good. You started to realize who you are.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Who I—wait a minute, what do you mean?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The weird bellowing noise rose up again somewhere behind us, closer than
                        before. Whatever was
                        chasing us was still on our trail. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy,” my mom said, “there’s too much to explain and not enough time. We have
                        to get you to
                        safety.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Safety from what? Who’s after me?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, nobody much,” Grover said, obviously still miffed about the donkey
                        comment. “Just the Lord
                        of the Dead and a few of his blood-thirstiest minions.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Grover!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Sorry, Mrs. Jackson. Could you drive faster, please?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I tried to wrap my mind around what was happening, but I couldn’t do it. I knew
                        this wasn’t a
                        dream. I had no imagination. I could never dream up something this weird. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My mom made a hard left. We swerved onto a narrower road, racing past darkened
                        farmhouses and
                        wooded hills and <small class="calibre4">PICK YOUR OWN STRAWBERRIES</small> signs on white
                        picket fences. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Where are we going?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The summer camp I told you about.” My mother’s voice was tight; she was trying
                        for my sake not
                        to be scared. “The place your father wanted to send you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The place you didn’t want me to go.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Please, dear,” my mother begged. “This is hard enough. Try to understand.
                        You’re in danger.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Because some old ladies cut yarn.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Those weren’t old ladies,” Grover said. “Those were the Fates. Do you know
                        what it means—the
                        fact they appeared in front of you? They only do that when you’re about to…when someone’s about
                        to die.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Whoa. You said ‘you.’” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No I didn’t. I said ‘someone.’” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You meant ‘you.’ As in <em class="calibre5">me</em>.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I meant <em class="calibre5">you</em>, like ‘someone.’ Not you, <em
                            class="calibre5">you</em>.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Boys!” my mom said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She pulled the wheel hard to the right, and I got a glimpse of a figure she’d
                        swerved to
                        avoid—a dark fluttering shape now lost behind us in the storm. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What was that?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We’re almost there,” my mother said, ignoring my question. “Another mile.
                        Please. Please.
                        Please.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I didn’t know where <em class="calibre5">there </em>was, but I found myself
                        leaning forward in
                        the car, anticipating, wanting us to arrive. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Outside, nothing but rain and darkness—the kind of empty countryside you get
                        way out on the tip
                        of Long Island. I thought about Mrs. Dodds and the moment when she’d changed into the thing with
                        pointed teeth
                        and leathery wings. My limbs went numb from delayed shock. She really <em
                            class="calibre5">hadn’t </em>been
                        human. She’d meant to kill me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then I thought about Mr. Brunner…and the sword he had thrown me. Before I could
                        ask Grover
                        about that, the hair rose on the back of my neck. There was a blinding flash, a jaw-rattling <em
                            class="calibre5">boom!</em>, and our car exploded. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I remember feeling weightless, like I was being crushed, fried, and hosed down
                        all at the same
                        time. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I peeled my forehead off the back of the driver’s seat and said, “Ow.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy!” my mom shouted. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m okay.…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I tried to shake off the daze. I wasn’t dead. The car hadn’t really exploded.
                        We’d swerved into
                        a ditch. Our driver’s-side doors were wedged in the mud. The roof had cracked open like an
                        eggshell and rain was
                        pouring in. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Lightning. That was the only explanation. We’d been blasted right off the road.
                        Next to me in
                        the backseat was a big motionless lump. “Grover!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He was slumped over, blood trickling from the side of his mouth. I shook his
                        furry hip,
                        thinking, No! Even if you are half barnyard animal, you’re my best friend and I don’t want you
                        to die! </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then he groaned “Food,” and I knew there was hope. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy,” my mother said, “we have to…” Her voice faltered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I looked back. In a flash of lightning, through the mud-spattered rear
                        windshield, I saw a
                        figure lumbering toward us on the shoulder of the road. The sight of it made my skin crawl. It
                        was a dark
                        silhouette of a huge guy, like a football player. He seemed to be holding a blanket over his
                        head. His top half
                        was bulky and fuzzy. His upraised hands made it look like he had horns. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img" src="../assets/images/scenes/4-1.png" alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">I swallowed hard. “Who is—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy,” my mother said, deadly serious. “Get out of the car.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My mother threw herself against the driver’s-side door. It was jammed shut in
                        the mud. I tried
                        mine. Stuck too. I looked up desperately at the hole in the roof. It might’ve been an exit, but
                        the edges were
                        sizzling and smoking. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Climb out the passenger’s side!” my mother told me. “Percy—you have to run. Do
                        you see that
                        big tree?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Another flash of lightning, and through the smoking hole in the roof I saw the
                        tree she meant:
                        a huge, White House Christmas tree–sized pine at the crest of the nearest hill. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“That’s the property line,” my mom said. “Get over that hill and you’ll see a
                        big farmhouse
                        down in the valley. Run and don’t look back. Yell for help. Don’t stop until you reach the
                        door.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Mom, you’re coming too.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Her face was pale, her eyes as sad as when she looked at the ocean. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No!” I shouted. “You <em class="calibre5">are </em>coming with me. Help me
                        carry Grover.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Food!” Grover moaned, a little louder. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The man with the blanket on his head kept coming toward us, making his
                        grunting, snorting
                        noises. As he got closer, I realized he <em class="calibre5">couldn’t </em>be holding a blanket
                        over his head,
                        because his hands—huge meaty hands—were swinging at his sides. There was no blanket. Meaning the
                        bulky, fuzzy
                        mass that was too big to be his head…was his head. And the points that looked like horns…</p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“He doesn’t want <em class="calibre5">us</em>,” my mother told me. “He wants
                        you. Besides, I
                        can’t cross the property line.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We don’t have time, Percy. Go. Please.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I got mad, then—mad at my mother, at Grover the goat, at the thing with horns
                        that was
                        lumbering toward us slowly and deliberately like, like a bull. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I climbed across Grover and pushed the door open into the rain. “We’re going
                        together. Come on,
                        Mom.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I told you—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Mom! I am not leaving you. Help me with Grover.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I didn’t wait for her answer. I scrambled outside, dragging Grover from the
                        car. He was
                        surprisingly light, but I couldn’t have carried him very far if my mom hadn’t come to my aid.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Together, we draped Grover’s arms over our shoulders and started stumbling
                        uphill through wet
                        waist-high grass. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Glancing back, I got my first clear look at the monster. He was seven feet
                        tall, easy, his arms
                        and legs like something from the cover of <em class="calibre5">Muscle Man </em>magazine—bulging
                        biceps and
                        triceps and a bunch of other ’ceps, all stuffed like baseballs under vein-webbed skin. He wore
                        no clothes except
                        underwear—I mean, bright white Fruit of the Looms—which would’ve looked funny, except that the
                        top half of his
                        body was so scary. Coarse brown hair started at about his belly button and got thicker as it
                        reached his
                        shoulders. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">His neck was a mass of muscle and fur leading up to his enormous head, which
                        had a snout as
                        long as my arm, snotty nostrils with a gleaming brass ring, cruel black eyes, and horns—enormous
                        black-and-white
                        horns with points you just couldn’t get from an electric sharpener. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I recognized the monster, all right. He had been in one of the first stories
                        Mr. Brunner told
                        us. But he couldn’t be real. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I blinked the rain out of my eyes. “That’s—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Pasiphae’s son,” my mother said. “I wish I’d known how badly they want to kill
                        you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But he’s the Min—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Don’t say his name,” she warned. “Names have power.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The pine tree was still way too far—a hundred yards uphill at least. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I glanced behind me again. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The bull-man hunched over our car, looking in the windows—or not looking,
                        exactly. More like
                        snuffling, nuzzling. I wasn’t sure why he bothered, since we were only about fifty feet away.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Food?” Grover moaned. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Shhh,” I told him. “Mom, what’s he doing? Doesn’t he see us?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“His sight and hearing are terrible,” she said. “He goes by smell. But he’ll
                        figure out where
                        we are soon enough.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">As if on cue, the bull-man bellowed in rage. He picked up Gabe’s Camaro by the
                        torn roof, the
                        chassis creaking and groaning. He raised the car over his head and threw it down the road. It
                        slammed into the
                        wet asphalt and skidded in a shower of sparks for about half a mile before coming to a stop. The
                        gas tank
                        exploded. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><em class="calibre5">Not a scratch, </em>I remembered Gabe saying. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Oops. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy,” my mom said. “When he sees us, he’ll charge. Wait until the last
                        second, then jump out
                        of the way—directly sideways. He can’t change directions very well once he’s charging. Do you
                        understand?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“How do you know all this?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’ve been worried about an attack for a long time. I should have expected
                        this. I was selfish,
                        keeping you near me.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Keeping me near you? But—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Another bellow of rage, and the bull-man started tromping uphill. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He’d smelled us. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The pine tree was only a few more yards, but the hill was getting steeper and
                        slicker, and
                        Grover wasn’t getting any lighter. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The bull-man closed in. Another few seconds and he’d be on top of us. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My mother must’ve been exhausted, but she shouldered Grover. “Go, Percy!
                        Separate! Remember
                        what I said.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I didn’t want to split up, but I had the feeling she was right—it was our only
                        chance. I
                        sprinted to the left, turned, and saw the creature bearing down on me. His black eyes glowed
                        with hate. He
                        reeked like rotten meat. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He lowered his head and charged, those razor-sharp horns aimed straight at my
                        chest. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The fear in my stomach made me want to bolt, but that wouldn’t work. I could
                        never outrun this
                        thing. So I held my ground, and at the last moment, I jumped to the side. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The bull-man stormed past like a freight train, then bellowed with frustration
                        and turned, but
                        not toward me this time, toward my mother, who was setting Grover down in the grass. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We’d reached the crest of the hill. Down the other side I could see a valley,
                        just as my mother
                        had said, and the lights of a farmhouse glowing yellow through the rain. But that was half a
                        mile away. We’d
                        never make it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The bull-man grunted, pawing the ground. He kept eyeing my mother, who was now
                        retreating
                        slowly downhill, back toward the road, trying to lead the monster away from Grover. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Run, Percy!” she told me. “I can’t go any farther. Run!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">But I just stood there, frozen in fear, as the monster charged her. She tried
                        to sidestep, as
                        she’d told me to do, but the monster had learned his lesson. His hand shot out and grabbed her
                        by the neck as
                        she tried to get away. He lifted her as she struggled, kicking and pummeling the air. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Mom!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She caught my eyes, managed to choke out one last word: “Go!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then, with an angry roar, the monster closed his fists around my mother’s neck,
                        and she
                        dissolved before my eyes, melting into light, a shimmering golden form, as if she were a
                        holographic projection.
                        A blinding flash, and she was simply…gone. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Anger replaced my fear. Newfound strength burned in my limbs—the same rush of
                        energy I’d gotten
                        when Mrs. Dodds grew talons. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The bull-man bore down on Grover, who lay helpless in the grass. The monster
                        hunched over,
                        snuffling my best friend, as if he were about to lift Grover up and make him dissolve too. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I couldn’t allow that. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stripped off my red rain jacket. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hey!” I screamed, waving the jacket, running to one side of the monster. “Hey,
                        stupid! Ground
                        beef!” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img" src="../assets/images/scenes/4-2.png" alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“Raaaarrrrr!” The monster turned toward me, shaking his meaty fists. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I had an idea—a stupid idea, but better than no idea at all. I put my back to
                        the big pine tree
                        and waved my red jacket in front of the bull-man, thinking I’d jump out of the way at the last
                        moment. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">But it didn’t happen like that. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The bull-man charged too fast, his arms out to grab me whichever way I tried to
                        dodge. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Time slowed down. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My legs tensed. I couldn’t jump sideways, so I leaped straight up, kicking off
                        from the
                        creature’s head, using it as a springboard, turning in midair, and landing on his neck. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">How did I do that? I didn’t have time to figure it out. A millisecond later,
                        the monster’s head
                        slammed into the tree and the impact nearly knocked my teeth out. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The bull-man staggered around, trying to shake me. I locked my arms around his
                        horns to keep
                        from being thrown. Thunder and lightning were still going strong. The rain was in my eyes. The
                        smell of rotten
                        meat burned my nostrils. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The monster shook himself around and bucked like a rodeo bull. He should have
                        just backed up
                        into the tree and smashed me flat, but I was starting to realize that this thing had only one
                        gear: forward.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Meanwhile, Grover started groaning in the grass. I wanted to yell at him to
                        shut up, but the
                        way I was getting tossed around, if I opened my mouth I’d bite my own tongue off. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Food!” Grover moaned. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The bull-man wheeled toward him, pawed the ground again, and got ready to
                        charge. I thought
                        about how he had squeezed the life out of my mother, made her disappear in a flash of light, and
                        rage filled me
                        like high-octane fuel. I got both hands around one horn and I pulled backward with all my might.
                        The monster
                        tensed, gave a surprised grunt, then—<em class="calibre5">snap! </em></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The bull-man screamed and flung me through the air. I landed flat on my back in
                        the grass. My
                        head smacked against a rock. When I sat up, my vision was blurry, but I had a horn in my hands,
                        a ragged bone
                        weapon the size of a knife. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The monster charged. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Without thinking, I rolled to one side and came up kneeling. As the monster
                        barreled past, I
                        drove the broken horn straight into his side, right up under his furry rib cage. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The bull-man roared in agony. He flailed, clawing at his chest, then began to
                        disintegrate—not
                        like my mother, in a flash of golden light, but like crumbling sand, blown away in chunks by the
                        wind, the same
                        way Mrs. Dodds had burst apart. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The monster was gone. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The rain had stopped. The storm still rumbled, but only in the distance. I
                        smelled like
                        livestock and my knees were shaking. My head felt like it was splitting open. I was weak and
                        scared and
                        trembling with grief. I’d just seen my mother vanish. I wanted to lie down and cry, but there
                        was Grover,
                        needing my help, so I managed to haul him up and stagger down into the valley, toward the lights
                        of the
                        farmhouse. I was crying, calling for my mother, but I held on to Grover—I wasn’t going to let
                        him go. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The last thing I remember is collapsing on a wooden porch, looking up at a
                        ceiling fan circling
                        above me, moths flying around a yellow light, and the stern faces of a familiar-looking bearded
                        man and a pretty
                        girl, her blond hair curled like a princess’s. They both looked down at me, and the girl said,
                        “He’s the one. He
                        must be.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Silence, Annabeth,” the man said. “He’s still conscious. Bring him inside.”

                    <p class="calibre13"><span class="bigcap">I</span> had weird dreams full of barnyard animals. Most
                        of them wanted to
                        kill me. The rest wanted food. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I must’ve woken up several times, but what I heard and saw made no sense, so I
                        just passed out
                        again. I remember lying in a soft bed, being spoon-fed something that tasted like buttered
                        popcorn, only it was
                        pudding. The girl with curly blond hair hovered over me, smirking as she scraped drips off my
                        chin with the
                        spoon. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">When she saw my eyes open, she asked, “What will happen at the summer
                        solstice?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I managed to croak, “What?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She looked around, as if afraid someone would overhear. “What’s going on? What
                        was stolen?
                        We’ve only got a few weeks!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m sorry,” I mumbled, “I don’t…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Somebody knocked on the door, and the girl quickly filled my mouth with
                        pudding. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The next time I woke up, the girl was gone. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A husky blond dude, like a surfer, stood in the corner of the bedroom keeping
                        watch over me. He
                        had blue eyes—at least a dozen of them—on his cheeks, his forehead, the backs of his hands. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15"></p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">When I finally came around for good, there was nothing weird about my
                        surroundings, except that
                        they were nicer than I was used to. I was sitting in a deck chair on a huge porch, gazing across
                        a meadow at
                        green hills in the distance. The breeze smelled like strawberries. There was a blanket over my
                        legs, a pillow
                        behind my neck. All that was great, but my mouth felt like a scorpion had been using it for a
                        nest. My tongue
                        was dry and nasty and every one of my teeth hurt. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">On the table next to me was a tall drink. It looked like iced apple juice, with
                        a green straw
                        and a paper parasol stuck through a maraschino cherry. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My hand was so weak I almost dropped the glass once I got my fingers around it.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Careful,” a familiar voice said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover was leaning against the porch railing, looking like he hadn’t slept in a
                        week. Under one
                        arm, he cradled a shoe box. He was wearing blue jeans, Converse hi-tops and a bright orange
                        T-shirt that said
                        <small class="calibre4">CAMP HALF-BLOOD</small>. Just plain old Grover. Not the goat boy.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">So maybe I’d had a nightmare. Maybe my mom was okay. We were still on vacation,
                        and we’d
                        stopped here at this big house for some reason. And…</p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You saved my life,” Grover said. “I…well, the least I could do…I went back to
                        the hill. I
                        thought you might want this.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Reverently, he placed the shoe box in my lap. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Inside was a black-and-white bull’s horn, the base jagged from being broken
                        off, the tip
                        splattered with dried blood. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It hadn’t been a nightmare. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The Minotaur,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Um, Percy, it isn’t a good idea—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“That’s what they call him in the Greek myths, isn’t it?” I demanded. “The
                        Minotaur. Half man,
                        half bull.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover shifted uncomfortably. “You’ve been out for two days. How much do you
                        remember?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“My mom. Is she really…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He looked down. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stared across the meadow. There were groves of trees, a winding stream, acres
                        of strawberries
                        spread out under the blue sky. The valley was surrounded by rolling hills, and the tallest one,
                        directly in
                        front of us, was the one with the huge pine tree on top. Even that looked beautiful in the
                        sunlight. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img" src="../assets/images/scenes/5-1.png" alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">My mother was gone. The whole world should be black and cold. Nothing should
                        look beautiful.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m sorry,” Grover sniffled. “I’m a failure. I’m—I’m the worst satyr in the
                        world.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He moaned, stomping his foot so hard it came off. I mean, the Converse hi-top
                        came off. The
                        inside was filled with Styrofoam, except for a hoof-shaped hole. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, Styx!” he mumbled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Thunder rolled across the clear sky. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">As he struggled to get his hoof back in the fake foot, I thought, Well, that
                        settles it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover was a satyr. I was ready to bet that if I shaved his curly brown hair,
                        I’d find tiny
                        horns on his head. But I was too miserable to care that satyrs existed, or even minotaurs. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">All that meant was my mom really had been squeezed into nothingness, dissolved
                        into yellow
                        light. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I was alone. An orphan. I would have to live with…Smelly Gabe? No. That would
                        never happen. I
                        would live on the streets first. I would pretend I was seventeen and join the army. I’d do
                        something. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover was still sniffling. The poor kid—poor goat, satyr, whatever—looked as
                        if he expected to
                        be hit. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I said, “It wasn’t your fault.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yes, it was. I was supposed to <em class="calibre5">protect </em>you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Did my mother ask you to protect me?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No. But that’s my job. I’m a keeper. At least…I was.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But why…” I suddenly felt dizzy, my vision swimming. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Don’t strain yourself,” Grover said. “Here.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He helped me hold my glass and put the straw to my lips. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I recoiled at the taste, because I was expecting apple juice. It wasn’t that at
                        all. It was
                        chocolate-chip cookies. Liquid cookies. And not just any cookies—my mom’s homemade blue
                        chocolate-chip cookies,
                        buttery and hot, with the chips still melting. Drinking it, my whole body felt warm and good,
                        full of energy. My
                        grief didn’t go away, but I felt as if my mom had just brushed her hand against my cheek, given
                        me a cookie the
                        way she used to when I was small, and told me everything was going to be okay. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Before I knew it, I’d drained the glass. I stared into it, sure I’d just had a
                        warm drink, but
                        the ice cubes hadn’t even melted. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Was it good?” Grover asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I nodded. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What did it taste like?” He sounded so wistful, I felt guilty. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Sorry,” I said. “I should’ve let you taste.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">His eyes got wide. “No! That’s not what I meant. I just…wondered.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Chocolate-chip cookies,” I said. “My mom’s. Homemade.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He sighed. “And how do you feel?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Like I could throw Nancy Bobofit a hundred yards.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“That’s good,” he said. “That’s good. I don’t think you could risk drinking any
                        more of that
                        stuff.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What do you mean?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He took the empty glass from me gingerly, as if it were dynamite, and set it
                        back on the table.
                        “Come on. Chiron and Mr. D are waiting.” </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">The porch wrapped all the way around the farmhouse. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My legs felt wobbly, trying to walk that far. Grover offered to carry the
                        Minotaur horn, but I
                        held on to it. I’d paid for that souvenir the hard way. I wasn’t going to let it go. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">As we came around the opposite end of the house, I caught my breath. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We must’ve been on the north shore of Long Island, because on this side of the
                        house, the
                        valley marched all the way up to the water, which glittered about a mile in the distance.
                        Between here and
                        there, I simply couldn’t process everything I was seeing. The landscape was dotted with
                        buildings that looked
                        like ancient Greek architecture—an open-air pavilion, an amphitheater, a circular arena—except
                        that they all
                        looked brand new, their white marble columns sparkling in the sun. In a nearby sandpit, a dozen
                        high school–age
                        kids and satyrs played volleyball. Canoes glided across a small lake. Kids in bright orange
                        T-shirts like
                        Grover’s were chasing each other around a cluster of cabins nestled in the woods. Some shot
                        targets at an
                        archery range. Others rode horses down a wooded trail, and, unless I was hallucinating, some of
                        their horses had
                        wings. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Down at the end of the porch, two men sat across from each other at a card
                        table. The
                        blond-haired girl who’d spoon-fed me popcorn-flavored pudding was leaning on the porch rail next
                        to them. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The man facing me was small, but porky. He had a red nose, big watery eyes, and
                        curly hair so
                        black it was almost purple. He looked like those paintings of baby angels—what do you call them,
                        hubbubs? No,
                        cherubs. That’s it. He looked like a cherub who’d turned middle-aged in a trailer park. He wore
                        a tiger-pattern
                        Hawaiian shirt, and he would’ve fit right in at one of Gabe’s poker parties, except I got the
                        feeling this guy
                        could’ve out-gambled even my stepfather. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“That’s Mr. D,” Grover murmured to me. “He’s the camp director. Be polite. The
                        girl, that’s
                        Annabeth Chase. She’s just a camper, but she’s been here longer than just about anybody. And you
                        already know
                        Chiron.…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He pointed at the guy whose back was to me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">First, I realized he was sitting in the wheelchair. Then I recognized the tweed
                        jacket, the
                        thinning brown hair, the scraggly beard. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Mr. Brunner!” I cried. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The Latin teacher turned and smiled at me. His eyes had that mischievous glint
                        they sometimes
                        got in class when he pulled a pop quiz and made all the multiple choice answers <em
                            class="calibre5">B</em>.
                    </p>
                    <img class="scene-img" src="../assets/images/scenes/5-2.png" alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“Ah, good, Percy,” he said. “Now we have four for pinochle.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He offered me a chair to the right of Mr. D, who looked at me with bloodshot
                        eyes and heaved a
                        great sigh. “Oh, I suppose I must say it. Welcome to Camp Half-Blood. There. Now, don’t expect
                        me to be glad to
                        see you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Uh, thanks.” I scooted a little farther away from him because, if there was
                        one thing I had
                        learned from living with Gabe, it was how to tell when an adult has been hitting the happy
                        juice. If Mr. D was a
                        stranger to alcohol, I was a satyr. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Annabeth?” Mr. Brunner called to the blond girl. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She came forward and Mr. Brunner introduced us. “This young lady nursed you
                        back to health,
                        Percy. Annabeth, my dear, why don’t you go check on Percy’s bunk? We’ll be putting him in cabin
                        eleven for now.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth said, “Sure, Chiron.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She was probably my age, maybe a couple of inches taller, and a whole lot more
                        athletic
                        looking. With her deep tan and her curly blond hair, she was almost exactly what I thought a
                        stereotypical
                        California girl would look like, except her eyes ruined the image. They were startling gray,
                        like storm clouds;
                        pretty, but intimidating, too, as if she were analyzing the best way to take me down in a fight.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She glanced at the minotaur horn in my hands, then back at me. I imagined she
                        was going to say,
                        <em class="calibre5">You killed a mino</em><em class="calibre5">taur! </em>or <em
                            class="calibre5">Wow, you’re
                            so awesome! </em>or something like that.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Instead she said, “You drool when you sleep.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then she sprinted off down the lawn, her blond hair flying behind her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“So,” I said, anxious to change the subject. “You, uh, work here, Mr. Brunner?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Not Mr. Brunner,” the ex–Mr. Brunner said. “I’m afraid that was a pseudonym.
                        You may call me
                        Chiron.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Okay.” Totally confused, I looked at the director. “And Mr. D…does that stand
                        for something?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Mr. D stopped shuffling the cards. He looked at me like I’d just belched
                        loudly. “Young man,
                        names are powerful things. You don’t just go around using them for no reason.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh. Right. Sorry.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I must say, Percy,” Chiron-Brunner broke in, “I’m glad to see you alive. It’s
                        been a long time
                        since I’ve made a house call to a potential camper. I’d hate to think I’ve wasted my time.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“House call?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“My year at Yancy Academy, to instruct you. We have satyrs at most schools, of
                        course, keeping
                        a lookout. But Grover alerted me as soon as he met you. He sensed you were something special, so
                        I decided to
                        come upstate. I convinced the other Latin teacher to…ah, take a leave of absence.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I tried to remember the beginning of the school year. It seemed like so long
                        ago, but I did
                        have a fuzzy memory of there being another Latin teacher my first week at Yancy. Then, without
                        explanation, he
                        had disappeared and Mr. Brunner had taken the class. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You came to Yancy just to teach me?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron nodded. “Honestly, I wasn’t sure about you at first. We contacted your
                        mother, let her
                        know we were keeping an eye on you in case you were ready for Camp Half-Blood. But you still had
                        so much to
                        learn. Nevertheless, you made it here alive, and that’s always the first test.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Grover,” Mr. D said impatiently, “are you playing or not?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yes, sir!” Grover trembled as he took the fourth chair, though I didn’t know
                        why he should be
                        so afraid of a pudgy little man in a tiger-print Hawaiian shirt. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You <em class="calibre5">do </em>know how to play pinochle?” Mr. D eyed me
                        suspiciously. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m afraid not,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m afraid not, <em class="calibre5">sir</em>,” he said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Sir,” I repeated. I was liking the camp director less and less. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Well,” he told me, “it is, along with gladiator fighting and Pac-Man, one of
                        the greatest
                        games ever invented by humans. I would expect all <em class="calibre5">civilized </em>young men
                        to know the
                        rules.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m sure the boy can learn,” Chiron said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Please,” I said, “what is this place? What am I doing here? Mr.
                        Brun—Chiron—why would you go
                        to Yancy Academy just to teach me?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Mr. D snorted. “I asked the same question.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The camp director dealt the cards. Grover flinched every time one landed in his
                        pile. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron smiled at me sympathetically, the way he used to in Latin class, as if
                        to let me know
                        that no matter what my average was, <em class="calibre5">I </em>was his star student. He
                        expected <em class="calibre5">me </em>to have the right answer. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy,” he said. “Did your mother tell you nothing?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“She said…” I remembered her sad eyes, looking out over the sea. “She told me
                        she was afraid to
                        send me here, even though my father had wanted her to. She said that once I was here, I probably
                        couldn’t leave.
                        She wanted to keep me close to her.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Typical,” Mr. D said. “That’s how they usually get killed. Young man, are you
                        bidding or not?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He explained, impatiently, how you bid in pinochle, and so I did. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m afraid there’s too much to tell,” Chiron said. “I’m afraid our usual
                        orientation film
                        won’t be sufficient.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Orientation film?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No,” Chiron decided. “Well, Percy. You know your friend Grover is a satyr. You
                        know”—he
                        pointed to the horn in the shoe box—“that you have killed the Minotaur. No small feat, either,
                        lad. What you may
                        not know is that great powers are at work in your life. Gods—the forces you call the Greek
                        gods—are very much
                        alive.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stared at the others around the table. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I waited for somebody to yell, <em class="calibre5">Not! </em>But all I got was
                        Mr. D yelling,
                        “Oh, a royal marriage. Trick! Trick!” He cackled as he tallied up his points. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Mr. D,” Grover asked timidly, “if you’re not going to eat it, could I have
                        your Diet Coke
                        can?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Eh? Oh, all right.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover bit a huge shard out of the empty aluminum can and chewed it mournfully.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Wait,” I told Chiron. “You’re telling me there’s such a thing as God.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Well, now,” Chiron said. “God—capital <em class="calibre5">G</em>, God. That’s
                        a different
                        matter altogether. We shan’t deal with the metaphysical.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Metaphysical? But you were just talking about—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Ah, gods, plural, as in, great beings that control the forces of nature and
                        human endeavors:
                        the immortal gods of Olympus. That’s a smaller matter.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Smaller?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yes, quite. The gods we discussed in Latin class.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Zeus,” I said. “Hera. Apollo. You mean them.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">And there it was again—distant thunder on a cloudless day. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Young man,” said Mr. D, “I would really be less casual about throwing those
                        names around, if I
                        were you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But they’re stories,” I said. “They’re—myths, to explain lightning and the
                        seasons and stuff.
                        They’re what people believed before there was science.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Science!” Mr. D scoffed. “And tell me, Perseus Jackson”—I flinched when he
                        said my real name,
                        which I never told anybody—“what will people think of your ‘science’ two thousand years from
                        now?” Mr. D
                        continued. “Hmm? They will call it primitive mumbo jumbo. That’s what. Oh, I love mortals—they
                        have absolutely
                        no sense of perspective. They think they’ve come <em class="calibre5">so-o-o </em>far. And have
                        they, Chiron?
                        Look at this boy and tell me.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I wasn’t liking Mr. D much, but there was something about the way he called me
                        mortal, as if…he
                        wasn’t. It was enough to put a lump in my throat, to suggest why Grover was dutifully minding
                        his cards, chewing
                        his soda can, and keeping his mouth shut. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy,” Chiron said, “you may choose to believe or not, but the fact is that
                        <em class="calibre5">immortal </em>means immortal. Can you imagine that for a moment, never
                        dying? Never fading?
                        Existing, just as you are, for all time?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I was about to answer, off the top of my head, that it sounded like a pretty
                        good deal, but the
                        tone of Chiron’s voice made me hesitate. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You mean, whether people believed in you or not,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Exactly,” Chiron agreed. “If you were a god, how would you like being called a
                        myth, an old
                        story to explain lightning? What if I told you, Perseus Jackson, that someday people would call
                        <em class="calibre5">you </em>a myth, just created to explain how little boys can get over
                        losing their
                        mothers?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My heart pounded. He was trying to make me angry for some reason, but I wasn’t
                        going to let
                        him. I said, “I wouldn’t like it. But I don’t believe in gods.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, you’d better,” Mr. D murmured. “Before one of them incinerates you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover said, “P-please, sir. He’s just lost his mother. He’s in shock.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“A lucky thing, too,” Mr. D grumbled, playing a card. “Bad enough I’m confined
                        to this
                        miserable job, working with boys who don’t even believe!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He waved his hand and a goblet appeared on the table, as if the sunlight had
                        bent, momentarily,
                        and woven the air into glass. The goblet filled itself with red wine. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My jaw dropped, but Chiron hardly looked up. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Mr. D,” he warned, “your restrictions.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Mr. D looked at the wine and feigned surprise. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Dear me.” He looked at the sky and yelled, “Old habits! Sorry!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">More thunder. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Mr. D waved his hand again, and the wineglass changed into a fresh can of Diet
                        Coke. He sighed
                        unhappily, popped the top of the soda, and went back to his card game. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron winked at me. “Mr. D offended his father a while back, took a fancy to a
                        wood nymph who
                        had been declared off-limits.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“A wood nymph,” I repeated, still staring at the Diet Coke can like it was from
                        outer space.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yes,” Mr. D confessed. “Father loves to punish me. The first time,
                        Prohibition. Ghastly!
                        Absolutely horrid ten years! The second time—well, she really was pretty, and I couldn’t stay
                        away—the second
                        time, he sent me here. Half-Blood Hill. Summer camp for brats like you. ‘Be a better influence,’
                        he told me.
                        ‘Work with youths rather than tearing them down.’ Ha! Absolutely unfair.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Mr. D sounded about six years old, like a pouting little kid. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“And…” I stammered, “your father is…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“<em class="calibre5">Di immortales</em>, Chiron,” Mr. D said. “I thought you
                        taught this boy
                        the basics. My father is Zeus, of course.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I ran through D names from Greek mythology. Wine. The skin of a tiger. The
                        satyrs that all
                        seemed to work here. The way Grover cringed, as if Mr. D were his master. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’re Dionysus,” I said. “The god of wine.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Mr. D rolled his eyes. “What do they say, these days, Grover? Do the children
                        say, ‘Well,
                        duh!’?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Y-yes, Mr. D.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Then, well, duh! Percy Jackson. Did you think I was Aphrodite, perhaps?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’re a god.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yes, child.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“A god. You.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He turned to look at me straight on, and I saw a kind of purplish fire in his
                        eyes, a hint that
                        this whiny, plump little man was only showing me the tiniest bit of his true nature. I saw
                        visions of grape
                        vines choking unbelievers to death, drunken warriors insane with battle lust, sailors screaming
                        as their hands
                        turned to flippers, their faces elongating into dolphin snouts. I knew that if I pushed him, Mr.
                        D would show me
                        worse things. He would plant a disease in my brain that would leave me wearing a straitjacket in
                        a rubber room
                        for the rest of my life. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Would you like to test me, child?” he said quietly. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No. No, sir.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The fire died a little. He turned back to his card game. “I believe I win.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Not quite, Mr. D,” Chiron said. He set down a straight, tallied the points,
                        and said, “The
                        game goes to me.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I thought Mr. D was going to vaporize Chiron right out of his wheelchair, but
                        he just sighed
                        through his nose, as if he were used to being beaten by the Latin teacher. He got up, and Grover
                        rose, too. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m tired,” Mr. D said. “I believe I’ll take a nap before the sing-along
                        tonight. But first,
                        Grover, we need to talk, <em class="calibre5">again, </em>about your less-than-perfect
                        performance on this
                        assignment.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover’s face beaded with sweat. “Y-yes, sir.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Mr. D turned to me. “Cabin eleven, Percy Jackson. And mind your manners.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He swept into the farmhouse, Grover following miserably. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Will Grover be okay?” I asked Chiron. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron nodded, though he looked a bit troubled. “Old Dionysus isn’t really mad.
                        He just hates
                        his job. He’s been…ah, grounded, I guess you would say, and he can’t stand waiting another
                        century before he’s
                        allowed to go back to Olympus.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Mount Olympus,” I said. “You’re telling me there really is a palace there?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Well now, there’s Mount Olympus in Greece. And then there’s the home of the
                        gods, the
                        convergence point of their powers, which did indeed used to be on Mount Olympus. It’s still
                        called Mount
                        Olympus, out of respect to the old ways, but the palace moves, Percy, just as the gods do.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You mean the Greek gods are here? Like…in <em class="calibre5">America</em>?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Well, certainly. The gods move with the heart of the West.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The what?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Come now, Percy. What you call ‘Western civilization.’ Do you think it’s just
                        an abstract
                        concept? No, it’s a living force. A collective consciousness that has burned bright for
                        thousands of years. The
                        gods are part of it. You might even say they are the source of it, or at least, they are tied so
                        tightly to it
                        that they couldn’t possibly fade, not unless all of Western civilization were obliterated. The
                        fire started in
                        Greece. Then, as you well know—or as I hope you know, since you passed my course—the heart of
                        the fire moved to
                        Rome, and so did the gods. Oh, different names, perhaps—Jupiter for Zeus, Venus for Aphrodite,
                        and so on—but the
                        same forces, the same gods.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“And then they died.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Died? No. Did the West die? The gods simply moved, to Germany, to France, to
                        Spain, for a
                        while. Wherever the flame was brightest, the gods were there. They spent several centuries in
                        England. All you
                        need to do is look at the architecture. People do not forget the gods. Every place they’ve
                        ruled, for the last
                        three thousand years, you can see them in paintings, in statues, on the most important
                        buildings. And yes,
                        Percy, of course they are now in your United States. Look at your symbol, the eagle of Zeus.
                        Look at the statue
                        of Prometheus in Rockefeller Center, the Greek facades of your government buildings in
                        Washington. I defy you to
                        find any American city where the Olympians are not prominently displayed in multiple places.
                        Like it or not—and
                        believe me, plenty of people weren’t very fond of Rome, either—America is now the heart of the
                        flame. It is the
                        great power of the West. And so Olympus is here. And we are here.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It was all too much, especially the fact that <em class="calibre5">I
                        </em>seemed to be included
                        in Chiron’s <em class="calibre5">we</em>, as if I were part of some club. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Who are you, Chiron? Who…who am I?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron smiled. He shifted his weight as if he were going to get up out of his
                        wheelchair, but I
                        knew that was impossible. He was paralyzed from the waist down. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Who are you?” he mused. “Well, that’s the question we all want answered, isn’t
                        it? But for
                        now, we should get you a bunk in cabin eleven. There will be new friends to meet. And plenty of
                        time for lessons
                        tomorrow. Besides, there will be s’mores at the campfire tonight, and I simply adore chocolate.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">And then he did rise from his wheelchair. But there was something odd about the
                        way he did it.
                        His blanket fell away from his legs, but the legs didn’t move. His waist kept getting longer,
                        rising above his
                        belt. At first, I thought he was wearing very long, white velvet underwear, but as he kept
                        rising out of the
                        chair, taller than any man, I realized that the velvet underwear wasn’t underwear; it was the
                        front of an
                        animal, muscle and sinew under coarse white fur. And the wheelchair wasn’t a chair. It was some
                        kind of
                        container, an enormous box on wheels, and it must’ve been magic, because there’s no way it
                        could’ve held all of
                        him. A leg came out, long and knobby-kneed, with a huge polished hoof. Then another front leg,
                        then
                        hindquarters, and then the box was empty, nothing but a metal shell with a couple of fake human
                        legs attached.
                    </p>
                    <img class="scene-img" src="../assets/images/scenes/5-3.png" alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">I stared at the horse who had just sprung from the wheelchair: a huge white
                        stallion. But where
                        its neck should be was the upper body of my Latin teacher, smoothly grafted to the horse’s
                        trunk. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What a relief,” the centaur said. “I’d been cooped up in there so long, my
                        fetlocks had fallen
                        asleep. Now, come, Percy Jackson. Let’s meet the other campers.” </p>

                    <p class="calibre13"><span class="bigcap">O</span>nce I got over the fact that my Latin teacher was
                        a horse, we had
                        a nice tour, though I was careful not to walk behind him. I’d done pooper-scooper patrol in the
                        Macy’s
                        Thanksgiving Day Parade a few times, and, I’m sorry, I did not trust Chiron’s back end the way I
                        trusted his
                        front. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We passed the volleyball pit. Several of the campers nudged each other. One
                        pointed to the
                        minotaur horn I was carrying. Another said, “That’s <em class="calibre5">him</em>.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Most of the campers were older than me. Their satyr friends were bigger than
                        Grover, all of
                        them trotting around in orange <small class="calibre4">CAMP HALF-BLOOD</small> T-shirts, with
                        nothing else to
                        cover their bare shaggy hindquarters. I wasn’t normally shy, but the way they stared at me made
                        me
                        uncomfortable. I felt like they were expecting me to do a flip or something. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I looked back at the farmhouse. It was a lot bigger than I’d realized—four
                        stories tall, sky
                        blue with white trim, like an upscale seaside resort. I was checking out the brass eagle weather
                        vane on top
                        when something caught my eye, a shadow in the uppermost window of the attic gable. Something had
                        moved the
                        curtain, just for a second, and I got the distinct impression I was being watched. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What’s up there?” I asked Chiron. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He looked where I was pointing, and his smile faded. “Just the attic.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Somebody lives there?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No,” he said with finality. “Not a single living thing.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I got the feeling he was being truthful. But I was also sure something had
                        moved that curtain.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Come along, Percy,” Chiron said, his lighthearted tone now a little forced.
                        “Lots to see.”
                    </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">We walked through the strawberry fields, where campers were picking bushels of
                        berries while a
                        satyr played a tune on a reed pipe. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron told me the camp grew a nice crop for export to New York restaurants and
                        Mount Olympus.
                        “It pays our expenses,” he explained. “And the strawberries take almost no effort.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He said Mr. D had this effect on fruit-bearing plants: they just went crazy
                        when he was around.
                        It worked best with wine grapes, but Mr. D was restricted from growing those, so they grew
                        strawberries instead.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I watched the satyr playing his pipe. His music was causing lines of bugs to
                        leave the
                        strawberry patch in every direction, like refugees fleeing a fire. I wondered if Grover could
                        work that kind of
                        magic with music. I wondered if he was still inside the farmhouse, getting chewed out by Mr. D.
                    </p>
                    <img class="scene-img" src="../assets/images/scenes/6-1.png" alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“Grover won’t get in too much trouble, will he?” I asked Chiron. “I mean…he was
                        a good
                        protector. Really.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron sighed. He shed his tweed jacket and draped it over his horse’s back
                        like a saddle.
                        “Grover has big dreams, Percy. Perhaps bigger than are reasonable. To reach his goal, he must
                        first demonstrate
                        great courage by succeeding as a keeper, finding a new camper and bringing him safely to
                        Half-Blood Hill.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But he did that!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I might agree with you,” Chiron said. “But it is not my place to judge.
                        Dionysus and the
                        Council of Cloven Elders must decide. I’m afraid they might not see this assignment as a
                        success. After all,
                        Grover lost you in New York. Then there’s the unfortunate…ah…fate of your mother. And the fact
                        that Grover was
                        unconscious when you dragged him over the property line. The council might question whether this
                        shows any
                        courage on Grover’s part.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I wanted to protest. None of what happened was Grover’s fault. I also felt
                        really, really
                        guilty. If I hadn’t given Grover the slip at the bus station, he might not have gotten in
                        trouble. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“He’ll get a second chance, won’t he?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron winced. “I’m afraid that <em class="calibre5">was </em>Grover’s second
                        chance, Percy.
                        The council was not anxious to give him another, either, after what happened the first time,
                        five years ago.
                        Olympus knows, I advised him to wait longer before trying again. He’s still so small for his
                        age.…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“How old is he?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, twenty-eight.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What! And he’s in sixth grade?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Satyrs mature half as fast as humans, Percy. Grover has been the equivalent of
                        a middle school
                        student for the past six years.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“That’s horrible.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Quite,” Chiron agreed. “At any rate, Grover is a late bloomer, even by satyr
                        standards, and
                        not yet very accomplished at woodland magic. Alas, he was anxious to pursue his dream. Perhaps
                        now he will find
                        some other career.…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“That’s not fair,” I said. “What happened the first time? Was it really so
                        bad?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron looked away quickly. “Let’s move along, shall we?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">But I wasn’t quite ready to let the subject drop. Something had occurred to me
                        when Chiron
                        talked about my mother’s fate, as if he were intentionally avoiding the word <em
                            class="calibre5">death</em>.
                        The beginnings of an idea—a tiny, hopeful fire—started forming in my mind. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Chiron,” I said. “If the gods and Olympus and all that are real…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yes, child?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Does that mean the Underworld is real, too?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron’s expression darkened. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yes, child.” He paused, as if choosing his words carefully. “There is a place
                        where spirits go
                        after death. But for now…until we know more…I would urge you to put that out of your mind.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What do you mean, ‘until we know more’?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Come, Percy. Let’s see the woods.” </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">As we got closer, I realized how huge the forest was. It took up at least a
                        quarter of the
                        valley, with trees so tall and thick, you could imagine nobody had been in there since the
                        Native Americans.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron said, “The woods are stocked, if you care to try your luck, but go
                        armed.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Stocked with what?” I asked. “Armed with what?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’ll see. Capture the flag is Friday night. Do you have your own sword and
                        shield?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“My own—?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No,” Chiron said. “I don’t suppose you do. I think a size five will do. I’ll
                        visit the armory
                        later.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I wanted to ask what kind of summer camp had an armory, but there was too much
                        else to think
                        about, so the tour continued. We saw the archery range, the canoeing lake, the stables (which
                        Chiron didn’t seem
                        to like very much), the javelin range, the sing-along amphitheater, and the arena where Chiron
                        said they held
                        sword and spear fights. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Sword and spear fights?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Cabin challenges and all that,” he explained. “Not lethal. Usually. Oh, yes,
                        and there’s the
                        mess hall.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron pointed to an outdoor pavilion framed in white Grecian columns on a hill
                        overlooking the
                        sea. There were a dozen stone picnic tables. No roof. No walls. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What do you do when it rains?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron looked at me as if I’d gone a little weird. “We still have to eat, don’t
                        we?” I decided
                        to drop the subject. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Finally, he showed me the cabins. There were twelve of them, nestled in the
                        woods by the lake.
                        They were arranged in a U, with two at the base and five in a row on either side. And they were
                        without doubt
                        the most bizarre collection of buildings I’d ever seen. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Except for the fact that each had a large brass number above the door (odds on
                        the left side,
                        evens on the right), they looked absolutely nothing alike. Number nine had smokestacks, like a
                        tiny factory.
                        Number four had tomato vines on the walls and a roof made out of real grass. Seven seemed to be
                        made of solid
                        gold, which gleamed so much in the sunlight it was almost impossible to look at. They all faced
                        a commons area
                        about the size of a soccer field, dotted with Greek statues, fountains, flower beds, and a
                        couple of basketball
                        hoops (which were more my speed). </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">In the center of the field was a huge stone-lined firepit. Even though it was a
                        warm afternoon,
                        the hearth smoldered. A girl about nine years old was tending the flames, poking the coals with
                        a stick. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The pair of cabins at the head of the field, numbers one and two, looked like
                        his-and-hers
                        mausoleums, big white marble boxes with heavy columns in front. Cabin one was the biggest and
                        bulkiest of the
                        twelve. Its polished bronze doors shimmered like a hologram, so that from different angles
                        lightning bolts
                        seemed to streak across them. Cabin two was more graceful somehow, with slimmer columns
                        garlanded with
                        pomegranates and flowers. The walls were carved with images of peacocks. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Zeus and Hera?” I guessed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Correct,” Chiron said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Their cabins look empty.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Several of the cabins are. That’s true. No one ever stays in one or two.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Okay. So each cabin had a different god, like a mascot. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Twelve cabins for the twelve Olympians. But why would some be empty? </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stopped in front of the first cabin on the left, cabin three. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It wasn’t high and mighty like cabin one, but long and low and solid. The outer
                        walls were of
                        rough gray stone studded with pieces of seashell and coral, as if the slabs had been hewn
                        straight from the
                        bottom of the ocean floor. I peeked inside the open doorway and Chiron said, “Oh, I wouldn’t do
                        that!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Before he could pull me back, I caught the salty scent of the interior, like
                        the wind on the
                        shore at Montauk. The interior walls glowed like abalone. There were six empty bunk beds with
                        silk sheets turned
                        down. But there was no sign anyone had ever slept there. The place felt so sad and lonely, I was
                        glad when
                        Chiron put his hand on my shoulder and said, “Come along, Percy.” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img" src="../assets/images/scenes/6-2.png" alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">Most of the other cabins were crowded with campers. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Number five was bright red—a real nasty paint job, as if the color had been
                        splashed on with
                        buckets and fists. The roof was lined with barbed wire. A stuffed wild boar’s head hung over the
                        doorway, and
                        its eyes seemed to follow me. Inside I could see a bunch of mean-looking kids, both girls and
                        boys, arm
                        wrestling and arguing with each other while rock music blared. The loudest was a girl maybe
                        thirteen or
                        fourteen. She wore a size XXXL <small class="calibre4">CAMP HALFBLOOD</small> T-shirt under a
                        camouflage jacket.
                        She zeroed in on me and gave me an evil sneer. She reminded me of Nancy Bobofit, though the
                        camper girl was much
                        bigger and tougher looking, and her hair was long and stringy, and brown instead of red. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I kept walking, trying to stay clear of Chiron’s hooves. “We haven’t seen any
                        other centaurs,”
                        I observed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No,” said Chiron sadly. “My kinsmen are a wild and barbaric folk, I’m afraid.
                        You might
                        encounter them in the wilderness, or at major sporting events. But you won’t see any here.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You said your name was Chiron. Are you really…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He smiled down at me. “<em class="calibre5">The </em>Chiron from the stories?
                        Trainer of
                        Hercules and all that? Yes, Percy, I am.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But, shouldn’t you be dead?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron paused, as if the question intrigued him. “I honestly don’t know about
                        <em class="calibre5">should </em>be. The truth is, I <em class="calibre5">can’t </em>be dead.
                        You see, eons ago
                        the gods granted my wish. I could continue the work I loved. I could be a teacher of heroes as
                        long as humanity
                        needed me. I gained much from that wish…and I gave up much. But I’m still here, so I can only
                        assume I’m still
                        needed.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I thought about being a teacher for three thousand years. It wouldn’t have made
                        my Top Ten
                        Things to Wish For list. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Doesn’t it ever get boring?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No, no,” he said. “Horribly depressing, at times, but never boring.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Why depressing?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron seemed to turn hard of hearing again. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, look,” he said. “Annabeth is waiting for us.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15"></p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">The blond girl I’d met at the Big House was reading a book in front of the last
                        cabin on the
                        left, number eleven. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">When we reached her, she looked me over critically, like she was still thinking
                        about how much
                        I drooled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I tried to see what she was reading, but I couldn’t make out the title. I
                        thought my dyslexia
                        was acting up. Then I realized the title wasn’t even English. The letters looked Greek to me. I
                        mean, literally
                        Greek. There were pictures of temples and statues and different kinds of columns, like those in
                        an architecture
                        book. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Annabeth,” Chiron said, “I have masters’ archery class at noon. Would you take
                        Percy from
                        here?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yes, sir.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Cabin eleven,” Chiron told me, gesturing toward the doorway. “Make yourself at
                        home.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Out of all the cabins, eleven looked the most like a regular old summer camp
                        cabin, with the
                        emphasis on <em class="calibre5">old</em>. The threshold was worn down, the brown paint peeling.
                        Over the
                        doorway was one of those doctor’s symbols, a winged pole with two snakes wrapped around it. What
                        did they call
                        it…? A caduceus. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Inside, it was packed with people, both boys and girls, way more than the
                        number of bunk beds.
                        Sleeping bags were spread all over on the floor. It looked like a gym where the Red Cross had
                        set up an
                        evacuation center. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron didn’t go in. The door was too low for him. But when the campers saw him
                        they all stood
                        and bowed respectfully. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Well, then,” Chiron said. “Good luck, Percy. I’ll see you at dinner.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He galloped away toward the archery range. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stood in the doorway, looking at the kids. They weren’t bowing anymore. They
                        were staring at
                        me, sizing me up. I knew this routine. I’d gone through it at enough schools. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Well?” Annabeth prompted. “Go on.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">So naturally I tripped coming in the door and made a total fool of myself.
                        There were some
                        snickers from the campers, but none of them said anything. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth announced, “Percy Jackson, meet cabin eleven.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Regular or undetermined?” somebody asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I didn’t know what to say, but Annabeth said, “Undetermined.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Everybody groaned. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A guy who was a little older than the rest came forward. “Now, now, campers.
                        That’s what we’re
                        here for. Welcome, Percy. You can have that spot on the floor, right over there.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The guy was about nineteen, and he looked pretty cool. He was tall and
                        muscular, with
                        short-cropped sandy hair and a friendly smile. He wore an orange tank top, cutoffs, sandals, and
                        a leather
                        necklace with five different-colored clay beads. The only thing unsettling about his appearance
                        was a thick
                        white scar that ran from just beneath his right eye to his jaw, like an old knife slash. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“This is Luke,” Annabeth said, and her voice sounded different somehow. I
                        glanced over and
                        could’ve sworn she was blushing. She saw me looking, and her expression hardened again. “He’s
                        your counselor for
                        now.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“For now?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’re undetermined,” Luke explained patiently. “They don’t know what cabin to
                        put you in, so
                        you’re here. Cabin eleven takes all newcomers, all visitors. Naturally, we would. Hermes, our
                        patron, is the god
                        of travelers.” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img" src="../assets/images/scenes/6-3.png" alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">I looked at the tiny section of floor they’d given me. I had nothing to put
                        there to mark it as
                        my own, no luggage, no clothes, no sleeping bag. Just the Minotaur’s horn. I thought about
                        setting that down,
                        but then I remembered that Hermes was also the god of thieves. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I looked around at the campers’ faces, some sullen and suspicious, some
                        grinning stupidly, some
                        eyeing me as if they were waiting for a chance to pick my pockets. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“How long will I be here?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Good question,” Luke said. “Until you’re determined.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“How long will that take?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The campers all laughed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Come on,” Annabeth told me. “I’ll show you the volleyball court.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’ve already seen it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Come on.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She grabbed my wrist and dragged me outside. I could hear the kids of cabin
                        eleven laughing
                        behind me. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">When we were a few feet away, Annabeth said, “Jackson, you have to do better
                        than that.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She rolled her eyes and mumbled under her breath, “I can’t believe I thought
                        you were the one.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What’s your problem?” I was getting angry now. “All I know is, I kill some
                        bull guy—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Don’t talk like that!” Annabeth told me. “You know how many kids at this camp
                        wish they’d had
                        your chance?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“To get killed?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“To fight the Minotaur! What do you think we train for?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I shook my head. “Look, if the thing I fought really was <em
                            class="calibre5">the
                        </em>Minotaur, the same one in the stories…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yes.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Then there’s only one.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yes.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“And he died, like, a gajillion years ago, right? Theseus killed him in the
                        labyrinth. So…”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Monsters don’t die, Percy. They can be killed. But they don’t die.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, thanks. That clears it up.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“They don’t have souls, like you and me. You can dispel them for a while, maybe
                        even for a
                        whole lifetime if you’re lucky. But they are primal forces. Chiron calls them archetypes.
                        Eventually, they
                        re-form.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I thought about Mrs. Dodds. “You mean if I killed one, accidentally, with a
                        sword—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The Fur…I mean, your math teacher. That’s right. She’s still out there. You
                        just made her
                        very, very mad.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“How did you know about Mrs. Dodds?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You talk in your sleep.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You almost called her something. A Fury? They’re Hades’ torturers, right?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth glanced nervously at the ground, as if she expected it to open up and
                        swallow her.
                        “You shouldn’t call them by name, even here. We call them the Kindly Ones, if we have to speak
                        of them at all.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Look, is there anything we <em class="calibre5">can </em>say without it
                        thundering?” I sounded
                        whiny, even to myself, but right then I didn’t care. “Why do I have to stay in cabin eleven,
                        anyway? Why is
                        everybody so crowded together? There are plenty of empty bunks right over there.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I pointed to the first few cabins, and Annabeth turned pale. “You don’t just
                        choose a cabin,
                        Percy. It depends on who your parents are. Or…your parent.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She stared at me, waiting for me to get it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“My mom is Sally Jackson,” I said. “She works at the candy store in Grand
                        Central Station. At
                        least, she used to.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m sorry about your mom, Percy. But that’s not what I mean. I’m talking about
                        your other
                        parent. Your dad.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“He’s dead. I never knew him.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth sighed. Clearly, she’d had this conversation before with other kids.
                        “Your father’s
                        not dead, Percy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“How can you say that? You know him?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No, of course not.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Then how can you say—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Because I know <em class="calibre5">you</em>. You wouldn’t be here if you
                        weren’t one of us.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You don’t know anything about me.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No?” She raised an eyebrow. “I bet you moved around from school to school. I
                        bet you were
                        kicked out of a lot of them.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“How—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Diagnosed with dyslexia. Probably ADHD, too.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I tried to swallow my embarrassment. “What does that have to do with anything?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Taken together, it’s almost a sure sign. The letters float off the page when
                        you read, right?
                        That’s because your mind is hardwired for ancient Greek. And the ADHD—you’re impulsive, can’t
                        sit still in the
                        classroom. That’s your battlefield reflexes. In a real fight, they’d keep you alive. As for the
                        attention
                        problems, that’s because you see too much, Percy, not too little. Your senses are better than a
                        regular
                        mortal’s. Of course the teachers want you medicated. Most of them are monsters. They don’t want
                        you seeing them
                        for what they are.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You sound like…you went through the same thing?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Most of the kids here did. If you weren’t like us, you couldn’t have survived
                        the Minotaur,
                        much less the ambrosia and nectar.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Ambrosia and nectar.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The food and drink we were giving you to make you better. That stuff would’ve
                        killed a normal
                        kid. It would’ve turned your blood to fire and your bones to sand and you’d be dead. Face it.
                        You’re a
                        half-blood.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A half-blood. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I was reeling with so many questions I didn’t know where to start. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then a husky voice yelled, “Well! A newbie!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I looked over. The big girl from the ugly red cabin was sauntering toward us.
                        She had three
                        other girls behind her, all big and ugly and mean looking like her, all wearing camo jackets.
                    </p>
                    <img class="scene-img" src="../assets/images/scenes/6-4.png" alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“Clarisse,” Annabeth sighed. “Why don’t you go polish your spear or something?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Sure, Miss Princess,” the big girl said. “So I can run you through with it
                        Friday night.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><em class="calibre5">“Erre es korakas!” </em>Annabeth said, which I somehow
                        understood was
                        Greek for ‘Go to the crows!’ though I had a feeling it was a worse curse than it sounded. “You
                        don’t stand a
                        chance.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We’ll pulverize you,” Clarisse said, but her eye twitched. Perhaps she wasn’t
                        sure she could
                        follow through on the threat. She turned toward me. “Who’s this little runt?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy Jackson,” Annabeth said, “meet Clarisse, Daughter of Ares.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I blinked. “Like…the war god?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Clarisse sneered. “You got a problem with that?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No,” I said, recovering my wits. “It explains the bad smell.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Clarisse growled. “We got an initiation ceremony for newbies, Prissy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Whatever. Come on, I’ll show you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Clarisse—” Annabeth tried to say. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Stay out of it, wise girl.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth looked pained, but she did stay out of it, and I didn’t really want
                        her help. I was
                        the new kid. I had to earn my own rep. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I handed Annabeth my minotaur horn and got ready to fight, but before I knew
                        it, Clarisse had
                        me by the neck and was dragging me toward a cinder-block building that I knew immediately was
                        the bathroom. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I was kicking and punching. I’d been in plenty of fights before, but this big
                        girl Clarisse had
                        hands like iron. She dragged me into the girls’ bathroom. There was a line of toilets on one
                        side and a line of
                        shower stalls down the other. It smelled just like any public bathroom, and I was thinking—as
                        much as I <em class="calibre5">could </em>think with Clarisse ripping my hair out—that if this
                        place belonged to the gods,
                        they should’ve been able to afford classier johns. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Clarisse’s friends were all laughing, and I was trying to find the strength I’d
                        used to fight
                        the Minotaur, but it just wasn’t there. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Like he’s ‘Big Three’ material,” Clarisse said as she pushed me toward one of
                        the toilets.
                        “Yeah, right. Minotaur probably fell over laughing, he was so stupid looking.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Her friends snickered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth stood in the corner, watching through her fingers. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Clarisse bent me over on my knees and started pushing my head toward the toilet
                        bowl. It reeked
                        like rusted pipes and, well, like what goes into toilets. I strained to keep my head up. I was
                        looking at the
                        scummy water, thinking, I will not go into that. I won’t. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then something happened. I felt a tug in the pit of my stomach. I heard the
                        plumbing rumble,
                        the pipes shudder. Clarisse’s grip on my hair loosened. Water shot out of the toilet, making an
                        arc straight
                        over my head, and the next thing I knew, I was sprawled on the bathroom tiles with Clarisse
                        screaming behind me.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I turned just as water blasted out of the toilet again, hitting Clarisse
                        straight in the face
                        so hard it pushed her down onto her butt. The water stayed on her like the spray from a fire
                        hose, pushing her
                        backward into a shower stall. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She struggled, gasping, and her friends started coming toward her. But then the
                        other toilets
                        exploded, too, and six more streams of toilet water blasted them back. The showers acted up,
                        too, and together
                        all the fixtures sprayed the camouflage girls right out of the bathroom, spinning them around
                        like pieces of
                        garbage being washed away. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img" src="../assets/images/scenes/6-5.png" alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">As soon as they were out the door, I felt the tug in my gut lessen, and the
                        water shut off as
                        quickly as it had started. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The entire bathroom was flooded. Annabeth hadn’t been spared. She was dripping
                        wet, but she
                        hadn’t been pushed out the door. She was standing in exactly the same place, staring at me in
                        shock. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I looked down and realized I was sitting in the only dry spot in the whole
                        room. There was a
                        circle of dry floor around me. I didn’t have one drop of water on my clothes. Nothing. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stood up, my legs shaky. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth said, “How did you…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I don’t know.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We walked to the door. Outside, Clarisse and her friends were sprawled in the
                        mud, and a bunch
                        of other campers had gathered around to gawk. Clarisse’s hair was flattened across her face. Her
                        camouflage
                        jacket was sopping and she smelled like sewage. She gave me a look of absolute hatred. “You are
                        dead, new boy.
                        You are totally dead.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I probably should have let it go, but I said, “You want to gargle with toilet
                        water again,
                        Clarisse? Close your mouth.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Her friends had to hold her back. They dragged her toward cabin five, while the
                        other campers
                        made way to avoid her flailing feet. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth stared at me. I couldn’t tell whether she was just grossed out or
                        angry at me for
                        dousing her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What?” I demanded. “What are you thinking?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m thinking,” she said, “that I want you on my team for capture the flag.”

                    <p class="calibre13"><span class="bigcap">W</span>ord of the bathroom incident spread immediately.
                        Wherever I went,
                        campers pointed at me and murmured something about toilet water. Or maybe they were just staring
                        at Annabeth,
                        who was still pretty much dripping wet. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She showed me a few more places: the metal shop (where kids were forging their
                        own swords), the
                        arts-and-crafts room (where satyrs were sandblasting a giant marble statue of a goat-man), and
                        the climbing
                        wall, which actually consisted of two facing walls that shook violently, dropped boulders,
                        sprayed lava, and
                        clashed together if you didn’t get to the top fast enough. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Finally we returned to the canoeing lake, where the trail led back to the
                        cabins. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’ve got training to do,” Annabeth said flatly. “Dinner’s at seven-thirty.
                        Just follow your
                        cabin to the mess hall.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Annabeth, I’m sorry about the toilets.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Whatever.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It wasn’t my fault.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She looked at me skeptically, and I realized it <em class="calibre5">was
                        </em>my fault. I’d
                        made water shoot out of the bathroom fixtures. I didn’t understand how. But the toilets had
                        responded to me. I
                        had become one with the plumbing. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You need to talk to the Oracle,” Annabeth said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Who?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Not who. What. The Oracle. I’ll ask Chiron.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stared into the lake, wishing somebody would give me a straight answer for
                        once. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I wasn’t expecting anybody to be looking back at me from the bottom, so my
                        heart skipped a beat
                        when I noticed two teenage girls sitting cross-legged at the base of the pier, about twenty feet
                        below. They
                        wore blue jeans and shimmering green T-shirts, and their brown hair floated loose around their
                        shoulders as
                        minnows darted in and out. They smiled and waved as if I were a long-lost friend. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I didn’t know what else to do. I waved back. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Don’t encourage them,” Annabeth warned. “Naiads are terrible flirts.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Naiads,” I repeated, feeling completely overwhelmed. “That’s it. I want to go
                        home now.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth frowned. “Don’t you get it, Percy? You <em class="calibre5">are
                        </em>home. This is the
                        only safe place on earth for kids like us.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You mean, mentally disturbed kids?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I mean <em class="calibre5">not human</em>. Not totally human, anyway.
                        Half-human.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Half-human and half-what?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I think you know.” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img" src="../assets/images/scenes/7-1.png" alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">I didn’t want to admit it, but I was afraid I did. I felt a tingling in my
                        limbs, a sensation I
                        sometimes felt when my mom talked about my dad. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“God,” I said. “Half-god.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth nodded. “Your father isn’t dead, Percy. He’s one of the Olympians.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“That’s…crazy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Is it? What’s the most common thing gods did in the old stories? They ran
                        around falling in
                        love with humans and having kids with them. Do you think they’ve changed their habits in the
                        last few
                        millennia?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But those are just—” I almost said <em class="calibre5">myths </em>again. Then
                        I remembered
                        Chiron’s warning that in two thousand years, <em class="calibre5">I </em>might be considered a
                        myth. “But if all
                        the kids here are half-gods—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Demigods,” Annabeth said. “That’s the official term. Or half-bloods.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Then who’s your dad?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Her hands tightened around the pier railing. I got the feeling I’d just
                        trespassed on a
                        sensitive subject. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“My dad is a professor at West Point,” she said. “I haven’t seen him since I
                        was very small. He
                        teaches American history.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“He’s human.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What? You assume it has to be a male god who finds a human female attractive?
                        How sexist is
                        that?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Who’s your mom, then?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Cabin six.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Meaning?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth straightened. “Athena. Goddess of wisdom and battle.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Okay, I thought. Why not? </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“And my dad?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Undetermined,” Annabeth said, “like I told you before. Nobody knows.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Except my mother. She knew.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Maybe not, Percy. Gods don’t always reveal their identities.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“My dad would have. He loved her.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth gave me a cautious look. She didn’t want to burst my bubble. “Maybe
                        you’re right.
                        Maybe he’ll send a sign. That’s the only way to know for sure: your father has to send you a
                        sign claiming you
                        as his son. Sometimes it happens.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You mean sometimes it doesn’t?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth ran her palm along the rail. “The gods are busy. They have a lot of
                        kids and they
                        don’t always…Well, sometimes they don’t care about us, Percy. They ignore us.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I thought about some of the kids I’d seen in the Hermes cabin, teenagers who
                        looked sullen and
                        depressed, as if they were waiting for a call that would never come. I’d known kids like that at
                        Yancy Academy,
                        shuffled off to boarding school by rich parents who didn’t have the time to deal with them. But
                        gods should
                        behave better. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“So I’m stuck here,” I said. “That’s it? For the rest of my life?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It depends,” Annabeth said. “Some campers only stay the summer. If you’re a
                        child of Aphrodite
                        or Demeter, you’re probably not a real powerful force. The monsters might ignore you, so you can
                        get by with a
                        few months of summer training and live in the mortal world the rest of the year. But for some of
                        us, it’s too
                        dangerous to leave. We’re year-rounders. In the mortal world, we attract monsters. They sense
                        us. They come to
                        challenge us. Most of the time, they’ll ignore us until we’re old enough to cause trouble—about
                        ten or eleven
                        years old, but after that, most demigods either make their way here, or they get killed off. A
                        few manage to
                        survive in the outside world and become famous. Believe me, if I told you the names, you’d know
                        them. Some don’t
                        even realize they’re demigods. But very, very few are like that.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“So monsters can’t get in here?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth shook her head. “Not unless they’re intentionally stocked in the woods
                        or specially
                        summoned by somebody on the inside.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Why would anybody want to summon a monster?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Practice fights. Practical jokes.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Practical jokes?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The point is, the borders are sealed to keep mortals and monsters out. From
                        the outside,
                        mortals look into the valley and see nothing unusual, just a strawberry farm.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“So…you’re a year-rounder?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth nodded. From under the collar of her T-shirt she pulled a leather
                        necklace with five
                        clay beads of different colors. It was just like Luke’s, except Annabeth’s also had a big gold
                        ring strung on
                        it, like a college ring. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’ve been here since I was seven,” she said. “Every August, on the last day of
                        summer session,
                        you get a bead for surviving another year. I’ve been here longer than most of the counselors,
                        and they’re all in
                        college.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Why did you come so young?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She twisted the ring on her necklace. “None of your business.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh.” I stood there for a minute in uncomfortable silence. “So…I could just
                        walk out of here
                        right now if I wanted to?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It would be suicide, but you could, with Mr. D’s or Chiron’s permission. But
                        they wouldn’t
                        give permission until the end of the summer session unless…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Unless?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You were granted a quest. But that hardly ever happens. The last time…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Her voice trailed off. I could tell from her tone that the last time hadn’t
                        gone well. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Back in the sick room,” I said, “when you were feeding me that stuff—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Ambrosia.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah. You asked me something about the summer solstice.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth’s shoulders tensed. “So you <em class="calibre5">do </em>know
                        something?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Well…no. Back at my old school, I overheard Grover and Chiron talking about
                        it. Grover
                        mentioned the summer solstice. He said something like we didn’t have much time, because of the
                        deadline. What
                        did that mean?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She clenched her fists. “I wish I knew. Chiron and the satyrs, they know, but
                        they won’t tell
                        me. Something is wrong in Olympus, something pretty major. Last time I was there, everything
                        seemed so <em class="calibre5">normal</em>.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’ve been to Olympus?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Some of us year-rounders—Luke and Clarisse and I and a few others—we took a
                        field trip during
                        winter solstice. That’s when the gods have their big annual council.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But…how did you get there?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The Long Island Railroad, of course. You get off at Penn Station. Empire State
                        Building,
                        special elevator to the six hundredth floor.” She looked at me like she was sure I must know
                        this already. “You
                        <em class="calibre5">are </em>a New Yorker, right?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, sure.” As far as I knew, there were only a hundred and two floors in the
                        Empire State
                        Building, but I decided not to point that out. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Right after we visited,” Annabeth continued, “the weather got weird, as if the
                        gods had
                        started fighting. A couple of times since, I’ve overheard satyrs talking. The best I can figure
                        out is that
                        something important was stolen. And if it isn’t returned by summer solstice, there’s going to be
                        trouble. When
                        you came, I was hoping…I mean—Athena can get along with just about anybody, except for Ares. And
                        of course she’s
                        got the rivalry with Poseidon. But, I mean, aside from that, I thought we could work together. I
                        thought you
                        might know something.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I shook my head. I wished I could help her, but I felt too hungry and tired and
                        mentally
                        overloaded to ask any more questions. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’ve got to get a quest,” Annabeth muttered to herself. “I’m <em
                            class="calibre5">not </em>too
                        young. If they would just tell me the problem…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I could smell barbecue smoke coming from somewhere nearby. Annabeth must’ve
                        heard my stomach
                        growl. She told me to go on, she’d catch me later. I left her on the pier, tracing her finger
                        across the rail as
                        if drawing a battle plan. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">Back at cabin eleven, everybody was talking and horsing around, waiting for
                        dinner. For the
                        first time, I noticed that a lot of the campers had similar features: sharp noses, upturned
                        eyebrows,
                        mischievous smiles. They were the kind of kids that teachers would peg as troublemakers.
                        Thankfully, nobody paid
                        much attention to me as I walked over to my spot on the floor and plopped down with my minotaur
                        horn. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The counselor, Luke, came over. He had the Hermes family resemblance, too. It
                        was marred by
                        that scar on his right cheek, but his smile was intact. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Found you a sleeping bag,” he said. “And here, I stole you some toiletries
                        from the camp
                        store.” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img" src="../assets/images/scenes/7-2.png" alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">I couldn’t tell if he was kidding about the stealing part. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I said, “Thanks.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No prob.” Luke sat next to me, pushed his back against the wall. “Tough first
                        day?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I don’t belong here,” I said. “I don’t even believe in gods.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah,” he said. “That’s how we all started. Once you start believing in them?
                        It doesn’t get
                        any easier.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The bitterness in his voice surprised me, because Luke seemed like a pretty
                        easygoing guy. He
                        looked like he could handle just about anything. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“So your dad is Hermes?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He pulled a switchblade out of his back pocket, and for a second I thought he
                        was going to gut
                        me, but he just scraped the mud off the sole of his sandal. “Yeah. Hermes.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The wing-footed messenger guy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“That’s him. Messengers. Medicine. Travelers, merchants, thieves. Anybody who
                        uses the roads.
                        That’s why you’re here, enjoying cabin eleven’s hospitality. Hermes isn’t picky about who he
                        sponsors.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I figured Luke didn’t mean to call me a nobody. He just had a lot on his mind.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You ever meet your dad?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Once.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I waited, thinking that if he wanted to tell me, he’d tell me. Apparently, he
                        didn’t. I
                        wondered if the story had anything to do with how he got his scar. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Luke looked up and managed a smile. “Don’t worry about it, Percy. The campers
                        here, they’re
                        mostly good people. After all, we’re extended family, right? We take care of each other.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He seemed to understand how lost I felt, and I was grateful for that, because
                        an older guy like
                        him—even if he was a counselor—should’ve steered clear of an uncool middle-schooler like me. But
                        Luke had
                        welcomed me into the cabin. He’d even stolen me some toiletries, which was the nicest thing
                        anybody had done for
                        me all day. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I decided to ask him my last big question, the one that had been bothering me
                        all afternoon.
                        “Clarisse, from Ares, was joking about me being ‘Big Three’ material. Then Annabeth…twice, she
                        said I might be
                        ‘the one.’ She said I should talk to the Oracle. What was that all about?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Luke folded his knife. “I hate prophecies.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What do you mean?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">His face twitched around the scar. “Let’s just say I messed things up for
                        everybody else. The
                        last two years, ever since my trip to the Garden of the Hesperides went sour, Chiron hasn’t
                        allowed any more
                        quests. Annabeth’s been dying to get out into the world. She pestered Chiron so much he finally
                        told her he
                        already knew her fate. He’d had a prophecy from the Oracle. He wouldn’t tell her the whole
                        thing, but he said
                        Annabeth wasn’t destined to go on a quest yet. She had to wait until…somebody special came to
                        the camp.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Somebody special?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Don’t worry about it, kid,” Luke said. “Annabeth wants to think every new
                        camper who comes
                        through here is the omen she’s been waiting for. Now, come on, it’s dinnertime.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The moment he said it, a horn blew in the distance. Somehow, I knew it was a
                        conch shell, even
                        though I’d never heard one before. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Luke yelled, “Eleven, fall in!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The whole cabin, about twenty of us, filed into the commons yard. We lined up
                        in order of
                        seniority, so of course I was dead last. Campers came from the other cabins, too, except for the
                        three empty
                        cabins at the end, and cabin eight, which had looked normal in the daytime, but was now starting
                        to glow silver
                        as the sun went down. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We marched up the hill to the mess hall pavilion. Satyrs joined us from the
                        meadow. Naiads
                        emerged from the canoeing lake. A few other girls came out of the woods—and when I say out of
                        the woods, I mean
                        <em class="calibre5">straight </em>out of the woods. I saw one girl, about nine or ten years
                        old, melt from the
                        side of a maple tree and come skipping up the hill.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">In all, there were maybe a hundred campers, a few dozen satyrs, and a dozen
                        assorted wood
                        nymphs and naiads. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">At the pavilion, torches blazed around the marble columns. A central fire
                        burned in a bronze
                        brazier the size of a bathtub. Each cabin had its own table, covered in white cloth trimmed in
                        purple. Four of
                        the tables were empty, but cabin eleven’s was way overcrowded. I had to squeeze on to the edge
                        of a bench with
                        half my butt hanging off. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I saw Grover sitting at table twelve with Mr. D, a few satyrs, and a couple of
                        plump blond boys
                        who looked just like Mr. D. Chiron stood to one side, the picnic table being way too small for a
                        centaur. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth sat at table six with a bunch of serious-looking athletic kids, all
                        with her gray eyes
                        and honey-blond hair. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Clarisse sat behind me at Ares’s table. She’d apparently gotten over being
                        hosed down, because
                        she was laughing and belching right alongside her friends. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Finally, Chiron pounded his hoof against the marble floor of the pavilion, and
                        everybody fell
                        silent. He raised a glass. “To the gods!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Everybody else raised their glasses. “To the gods!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Wood nymphs came forward with platters of food: grapes, apples, strawberries,
                        cheese, fresh
                        bread, and yes, barbecue! My glass was empty, but Luke said, “Speak to it. Whatever you
                        want—nonalcoholic, of
                        course.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I said, “Cherry Coke.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The glass filled with sparkling caramel liquid. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then I had an idea. “<em class="calibre5">Blue </em>Cherry Coke.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The soda turned a violent shade of cobalt. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I took a cautious sip. Perfect. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I drank a toast to my mother. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She’s not gone, I told myself. Not permanently, anyway. She’s in the
                        Underworld. And if that’s
                        a real place, then someday…</p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Here you go, Percy,” Luke said, handing me a platter of smoked brisket. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I loaded my plate and was about to take a big bite when I noticed everybody
                        getting up,
                        carrying their plates toward the fire in the center of the pavilion. I wondered if they were
                        going for dessert
                        or something. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Come on,” Luke told me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">As I got closer, I saw that everyone was taking a portion of their meal and
                        dropping it into
                        the fire, the ripest strawberry, the juiciest slice of beef, the warmest, most buttery roll.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Luke murmured in my ear, “Burnt offerings for the gods. They like the smell.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’re kidding.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">His look warned me not to take this lightly, but I couldn’t help wondering why
                        an immortal,
                        all-powerful being would like the smell of burning food. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Luke approached the fire, bowed his head, and tossed in a cluster of fat red
                        grapes. “Hermes.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I was next. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I wished I knew what god’s name to say. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Finally, I made a silent plea. <em class="calibre5">Whoever you are, tell me.
                            Please. </em></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I scraped a big slice of brisket into the flames. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">When I caught a whiff of the smoke, I didn’t gag. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It smelled nothing like burning food. It smelled of hot chocolate and
                        fresh-baked brownies,
                        hamburgers on the grill and wildflowers, and a hundred other good things that shouldn’t have
                        gone well together,
                        but did. I could almost believe the gods could live off that smoke. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">When everybody had returned to their seats and finished eating their meals,
                        Chiron pounded his
                        hoof again for our attention. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Mr. D got up with a huge sigh. “Yes, I suppose I’d better say hello to all you
                        brats. Well,
                        hello. Our activities director, Chiron, says the next capture the flag is Friday. Cabin five
                        presently holds the
                        laurels.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A bunch of ugly cheering rose from the Ares table. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Personally,” Mr. D continued, “I couldn’t care less, but congratulations.
                        Also, I should tell
                        you that we have a new camper today. Peter Johnson.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron murmured something. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Er, Percy Jackson,” Mr. D corrected. “That’s right. Hurrah, and all that. Now
                        run along to
                        your silly campfire. Go on.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Everybody cheered. We all headed down toward the amphitheater, where Apollo’s
                        cabin led a
                        sing-along. We sang camp songs about the gods and ate s’mores and joked around, and the funny
                        thing was, I
                        didn’t feel that anyone was staring at me anymore. I felt that I was home. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img" src="../assets/images/scenes/7-3.png" alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">Later in the evening, when the sparks from the campfire were curling into a
                        starry sky, the
                        conch horn blew again, and we all filed back to our cabins. I didn’t realize how exhausted I was
                        until I
                        collapsed on my borrowed sleeping bag. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My fingers curled around the Minotaur’s horn. I thought about my mom, but I had
                        good thoughts:
                        her smile, the bedtime stories she would read me when I was a kid, the way she would tell me not
                        to let the
                        bedbugs bite. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">When I closed my eyes, I fell asleep instantly. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">That was my first day at Camp Half-Blood. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I wish I’d known how briefly I would get to enjoy my new home. </p>

                    <p class="calibre13"><span class="bigcap">T</span>he next few days I settled into a routine that
                        felt almost normal,
                        if you don’t count the fact that I was getting lessons from satyrs, nymphs, and a centaur. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Each morning I took Ancient Greek from Annabeth, and we talked about the gods
                        and goddesses in
                        the present tense, which was kind of weird. I discovered Annabeth was right about my dyslexia:
                        Ancient Greek
                        wasn’t that hard for me to read. At least, no harder than English. After a couple of mornings, I
                        could stumble
                        through a few lines of Homer without too much headache. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The rest of the day, I’d rotate through outdoor activities, looking for
                        something I was good
                        at. Chiron tried to teach me archery, but we found out pretty quick I wasn’t any good with a bow
                        and arrow. He
                        didn’t complain, even when he had to desnag a stray arrow out of his tail. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Foot racing? No good either. The wood-nymph instructors left me in the dust.
                        They told me not
                        to worry about it. They’d had centuries of practice running away from lovesick gods. But still,
                        it was a little
                        humiliating to be slower than a tree. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">And wrestling? Forget it. Every time I got on the mat, Clarisse would pulverize
                        me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“There’s more where that came from, punk,” she’d mumble in my ear. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The only thing I really excelled at was canoeing, and that wasn’t the kind of
                        heroic skill
                        people expected to see from the kid who had beaten the Minotaur. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I knew the senior campers and counselors were watching me, trying to decide who
                        my dad was, but
                        they weren’t having an easy time of it. I wasn’t as strong as the Ares kids, or as good at
                        archery as the Apollo
                        kids. I didn’t have Hephaestus’s skill with metalwork or—gods forbid—Dionysus’s way with vine
                        plants. Luke told
                        me I might be a child of Hermes, a kind of jack-of-all-trades, master of none. But I got the
                        feeling he was just
                        trying to make me feel better. He really didn’t know what to make of me either. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Despite all that, I liked camp. I got used to the morning fog over the beach,
                        the smell of hot
                        strawberry fields in the afternoon, even the weird noises of monsters in the woods at night. I
                        would eat dinner
                        with cabin eleven, scrape part of my meal into the fire, and try to feel some connection to my
                        real dad. Nothing
                        came. Just that warm feeling I’d always had, like the memory of his smile. I tried not to think
                        too much about
                        my mom, but I kept wondering: if gods and monsters were real, if all this magical stuff was
                        possible, surely
                        there was some way to save her, to bring her back.…</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I started to understand Luke’s bitterness and how he seemed to resent his
                        father, Hermes. So
                        okay, maybe gods had important things to do. But couldn’t they call once in a while, or thunder,
                        or something?
                        Dionysus could make Diet Coke appear out of thin air. Why couldn’t my dad, whoever he was, make
                        a phone appear?
                    </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">Thursday afternoon, three days after I’d arrived at Camp Half-Blood, I had my
                        first
                        sword-fighting lesson. Everybody from cabin eleven gathered in the big circular arena, where
                        Luke would be our
                        instructor. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We started with basic stabbing and slashing, using some straw-stuffed dummies
                        in Greek armor. I
                        guess I did okay. At least, I understood what I was supposed to do and my reflexes were good.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The problem was, I couldn’t find a blade that felt right in my hands. Either
                        they were too
                        heavy, or too light, or too long. Luke tried his best to fix me up, but he agreed that none of
                        the practice
                        blades seemed to work for me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We moved on to dueling in pairs. Luke announced he would be my partner, since
                        this was my first
                        time. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Good luck,” one of the campers told me. “Luke’s the best swordsman in the last
                        three hundred
                        years.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Maybe he’ll go easy on me,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The camper snorted. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Luke showed me thrusts and parries and shield blocks the hard way. With every
                        swipe, I got a
                        little more battered and bruised. “Keep your guard up, Percy,” he’d say, then whap me in the
                        ribs with the flat
                        of his blade. “No, not that far up!” <em class="calibre5">Whap! </em>“Lunge!” <em
                            class="calibre5">Whap!
                        </em>“Now, back!” <em class="calibre5">Whap! </em></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">By the time he called a break, I was soaked in sweat. Everybody swarmed the
                        drinks cooler. Luke
                        poured ice water on his head, which looked like such a good idea, I did the same. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Instantly, I felt better. Strength surged back into my arms. The sword didn’t
                        feel so awkward.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Okay, everybody circle up!” Luke ordered. “If Percy doesn’t mind, I want to
                        give you a little
                        demo.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Great, I thought. Let’s all watch Percy get pounded. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The Hermes guys gathered around. They were suppressing smiles. I figured they’d
                        been in my
                        shoes before and couldn’t wait to see how Luke used me for a punching bag. He told everybody he
                        was going to
                        demonstrate a disarming technique: how to twist the enemy’s blade with the flat of your own
                        sword so that he had
                        no choice but to drop his weapon. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“This is difficult,” he stressed. “I’ve had it used against me. No laughing at
                        Percy, now. Most
                        swordsmen have to work years to master this technique.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He demonstrated the move on me in slow motion. Sure enough, the sword clattered
                        out of my hand.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Now in real time,” he said, after I’d retrieved my weapon. “We keep sparring
                        until one of us
                        pulls it off. Ready, Percy?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I nodded, and Luke came after me. Somehow, I kept him from getting a shot at
                        the hilt of my
                        sword. My senses opened up. I saw his attacks coming. I countered. I stepped forward and tried a
                        thrust of my
                        own. Luke deflected it easily, but I saw a change in his face. His eyes narrowed, and he started
                        to press me
                        with more force. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The sword grew heavy in my hand. The balance wasn’t right. I knew it was only a
                        matter of
                        seconds before Luke took me down, so I figured, What the heck? </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I tried the disarming maneuver. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My blade hit the base of Luke’s and I twisted, putting my whole weight into a
                        downward thrust.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><em class="calibre5">Clang.</em></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Luke’s sword rattled against the stones. The tip of my blade was an inch from
                        his undefended
                        chest. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img" src="../assets/images/scenes/8-1.png" alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">The other campers were silent. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I lowered my sword. “Um, sorry.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">For a moment, Luke was too stunned to speak. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Sorry?” His scarred face broke into a grin. “By the gods, Percy, why are you
                        sorry? Show me
                        that again!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I didn’t want to. The short burst of manic energy had completely abandoned me.
                        But Luke
                        insisted. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">This time, there was no contest. The moment our swords connected, Luke hit my
                        hilt and sent my
                        weapon skidding across the floor. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">After a long pause, somebody in the audience said, “Beginner’s luck?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Luke wiped the sweat off his brow. He appraised me with an entirely new
                        interest. “Maybe,” he
                        said. “But I wonder what Percy could do with a balanced sword.…” </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">Friday afternoon, I was sitting with Grover at the lake, resting from a
                        near-death experience
                        on the climbing wall. Grover had scampered to the top like a mountain goat, but the lava had
                        almost gotten me.
                        My shirt had smoking holes in it. The hairs had been singed off my forearms. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We sat on the pier, watching the naiads do underwater basket-weaving, until I
                        got up the nerve
                        to ask Grover how his conversation had gone with Mr. D. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">His face turned a sickly shade of yellow. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Fine,” he said. “Just great.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“So your career’s still on track?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He glanced at me nervously. “Chiron t-told you I want a searcher’s license?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Well…no.” I had no idea what a searcher’s license was, but it didn’t seem like
                        the right time
                        to ask. “He just said you had big plans, you know…and that you needed credit for completing a
                        keeper’s
                        assignment. So did you get it?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover looked down at the naiads. “Mr. D suspended judgment. He said I hadn’t
                        failed or
                        succeeded with you yet, so our fates were still tied together. If you got a quest and I went
                        along to protect
                        you, and we both came back alive, then maybe he’d consider the job complete.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My spirits lifted. “Well, that’s not so bad, right?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“<em class="calibre5">Blaa-ha-ha! </em>He might as well have transferred me to
                        stable-cleaning
                        duty. The chances of you getting a quest…and even if you did, why would you want <em
                            class="calibre5">me
                        </em>along?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Of course I’d want you along!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover stared glumly into the water. “Basket-weaving…Must be nice to have a
                        useful skill.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I tried to reassure him that he had lots of talents, but that just made him
                        look more
                        miserable. We talked about canoeing and swordplay for a while, then debated the pros and cons of
                        the different
                        gods. Finally, I asked him about the four empty cabins. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Number eight, the silver one, belongs to Artemis,” he said. “She vowed to be a
                        maiden forever.
                        So of course, no kids. The cabin is, you know, honorary. If she didn’t have one, she’d be mad.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah, okay. But the other three, the ones at the end. Are those the Big
                        Three?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover tensed. We were getting close to a touchy subject. “No. One of them,
                        number two, is
                        Hera’s,” he said. “That’s another honorary thing. She’s the goddess of marriage, so of course
                        she wouldn’t go
                        around having affairs with mortals. That’s her husband’s job. When we say the Big Three, we mean
                        the three
                        powerful brothers, the sons of Kronos.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Zeus, Poseidon, Hades.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Right. You know. After the great battle with the Titans, they took over the
                        world from their
                        dad and drew lots to decide who got what.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Zeus got the sky,” I remembered. “Poseidon the sea, Hades the Underworld.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Uh-huh.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But Hades doesn’t have a cabin here.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No. He doesn’t have a throne on Olympus, either. He sort of does his own thing
                        down in the
                        Underworld. If he did have a cabin here…” Grover shuddered. “Well, it wouldn’t be pleasant.
                        Let’s leave it at
                        that.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But Zeus and Poseidon—they both had, like, a bazillion kids in the myths. Why
                        are their cabins
                        empty?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover shifted his hooves uncomfortably. “About sixty years ago, after World
                        War II, the Big
                        Three agreed they wouldn’t sire any more heroes. Their children were just too powerful. They
                        were affecting the
                        course of human events too much, causing too much carnage. World War II, you know, that was
                        basically a fight
                        between the sons of Zeus and Poseidon on one side, and the sons of Hades on the other. The
                        winning side, Zeus
                        and Poseidon, made Hades swear an oath with them: no more affairs with mortal women. They all
                        swore on the River
                        Styx.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Thunder boomed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I said, “That’s the most serious oath you can make.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover nodded. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“And the brothers kept their word—no kids?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover’s face darkened. “Seventeen years ago, Zeus fell off the wagon. There
                        was this TV
                        starlet with a big fluffy eighties hairdo—he just couldn’t help himself. When their child was
                        born, a little
                        girl named Thalia…well, the River Styx is serious about promises. Zeus himself got off easy
                        because he’s
                        immortal, but he brought a terrible fate on his daughter.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But that isn’t fair! It wasn’t the little girl’s fault.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover hesitated. “Percy, children of the Big Three have powers greater than
                        other half-bloods.
                        They have a strong aura, a scent that attracts monsters. When Hades found out about the girl, he
                        wasn’t too
                        happy about Zeus breaking his oath. Hades let the worst monsters out of Tartarus to torment
                        Thalia. A satyr was
                        assigned to be her keeper when she was twelve, but there was nothing he could do. He tried to
                        escort her here
                        with a couple of other half-bloods she’d befriended. They almost made it. They got all the way
                        to the top of
                        that hill.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He pointed across the valley, to the pine tree where I’d fought the minotaur.
                        “All three Kindly
                        Ones were after them, along with a hoard of hellhounds. They were about to be overrun when
                        Thalia told her satyr
                        to take the other two half-bloods to safety while she held off the monsters. She was wounded and
                        tired, and she
                        didn’t want to live like a hunted animal. The satyr didn’t want to leave her, but he couldn’t
                        change her mind,
                        and he had to protect the others. So Thalia made her final stand alone, at the top of that hill.
                        As she died,
                        Zeus took pity on her. He turned her into that pine tree. Her spirit still helps protect the
                        borders of the
                        valley. That’s why the hill is called Half-Blood Hill.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stared at the pine in the distance. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img" src="../assets/images/scenes/8-2.png" alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">The story made me feel hollow, and guilty too. A girl my age had sacrificed
                        herself to save her
                        friends. She had faced a whole army of monsters. Next to that, my victory over the Minotaur
                        didn’t seem like
                        much. I wondered, if I’d acted differently, could I have saved my mother? </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Grover,” I said, “have heroes really gone on quests to the Underworld?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Sometimes,” he said. “Orpheus. Hercules. Houdini.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“And have they ever returned somebody from the dead?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No. Never. Orpheus came close.…Percy, you’re not seriously thinking—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No,” I lied. “I was just wondering. So…a satyr is always assigned to guard a
                        demigod?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover studied me warily. I hadn’t persuaded him that I’d really dropped the
                        Underworld idea.
                        “Not always. We go undercover to a lot of schools. We try to sniff out the half-bloods who have
                        the makings of
                        great heroes. If we find one with a very strong aura, like a child of the Big Three, we alert
                        Chiron. He tries
                        to keep an eye on them, since they could cause really huge problems.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“And you found me. Chiron said you thought I might be something special.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover looked as if I’d just led him into a trap. “I didn’t…Oh, listen, don’t
                        think like that.
                        If you <em class="calibre5">were</em>—you know—you’d never <em class="calibre5">ever </em>be
                        allowed a quest,
                        and I’d never get my license. You’re probably a child of Hermes. Or maybe even one of the minor
                        gods, like
                        Nemesis, the god of revenge. Don’t worry, okay?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I got the idea he was reassuring himself more than me. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">That night after dinner, there was a lot more excitement than usual. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">At last, it was time for capture the flag. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">When the plates were cleared away, the conch horn sounded and we all stood at
                        our tables. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Campers yelled and cheered as Annabeth and two of her siblings ran into the
                        pavilion carrying a
                        silk banner. It was about ten feet long, glistening gray, with a painting of a barn owl above an
                        olive tree.
                        From the opposite side of the pavilion, Clarisse and her buddies ran in with another banner, of
                        identical size,
                        but gaudy red, painted with a bloody spear and a boar’s head. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I turned to Luke and yelled over the noise, “Those are the flags?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Ares and Athena always lead the teams?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Not always,” he said. “But often.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“So, if another cabin captures one, what do you do—repaint the flag?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He grinned. “You’ll see. First we have to get one.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Whose side are we on?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He gave me a sly look, as if he knew something I didn’t. The scar on his face
                        made him look
                        almost evil in the torchlight. “We’ve made a temporary alliance with Athena. Tonight, we get the
                        flag from Ares.
                        And <em class="calibre5">you </em>are going to help.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The teams were announced. Athena had made an alliance with Apollo and Hermes,
                        the two biggest
                        cabins. Apparently, privileges had been traded—shower times, chore schedules, the best slots for
                        activities—in
                        order to win support. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Ares had allied themselves with everybody else: Dionysus, Demeter, Aphrodite,
                        and Hephaestus.
                        From what I’d seen, Dionysus’s kids were actually good athletes, but there were only two of
                        them. Demeter’s kids
                        had the edge with nature skills and outdoor stuff, but they weren’t very aggressive. Aphrodite’s
                        sons and
                        daughters I wasn’t too worried about. They mostly sat out every activity and checked their
                        reflections in the
                        lake and did their hair and gossiped. Hephaestus’s kids weren’t pretty, and there were only four
                        of them, but
                        they were big and burly from working in the metal shop all day. They might be a problem. That,
                        of course, left
                        Ares’s cabin: a dozen of the biggest, ugliest, meanest kids on Long Island, or anywhere else on
                        the planet. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron hammered his hoof on the marble. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Heroes!” he announced. “You know the rules. The creek is the boundary line.
                        The entire forest
                        is fair game. All magic items are allowed. The banner must be prominently displayed, and have no
                        more than two
                        guards. Prisoners may be disarmed, but may not be bound or gagged. No killing or maiming is
                        allowed. I will
                        serve as referee and battlefield medic. Arm yourselves!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He spread his hands, and the tables were suddenly covered with equipment:
                        helmets, bronze
                        swords, spears, oxhide shields coated in metal. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Whoa,” I said. “We’re really supposed to use these?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Luke looked at me as if I were crazy. “Unless you want to get skewered by your
                        friends in cabin
                        five. Here—Chiron thought these would fit. You’ll be on border patrol.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My shield was the size of an NBA backboard, with a big caduceus in the middle.
                        It weighed about
                        a million pounds. I could have snowboarded on it fine, but I hoped nobody seriously expected me
                        to run fast. My
                        helmet, like all the helmets on Athena’s side, had a blue horsehair plume on top. Ares and their
                        allies had red
                        plumes. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth yelled, “Blue team, forward!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We cheered and shook our swords and followed her down the path to the south
                        woods. The red team
                        yelled taunts at us as they headed off toward the north. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I managed to catch up with Annabeth without tripping over my equipment. “Hey.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She kept marching. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“So what’s the plan?” I asked. “Got any magic items you can loan me?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Her hand drifted toward her pocket, as if she were afraid I’d stolen something.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Just watch Clarisse’s spear,” she said. “You don’t want that thing touching
                        you. Otherwise,
                        don’t worry. We’ll take the banner from Ares. Has Luke given you your job?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Border patrol, whatever that means.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It’s easy. Stand by the creek, keep the reds away. Leave the rest to me.
                        Athena always has a
                        plan.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She pushed ahead, leaving me in the dust. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Okay,” I mumbled. “Glad you wanted me on your team.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It was a warm, sticky night. The woods were dark, with fireflies popping in and
                        out of view.
                        Annabeth stationed me next to a little creek that gurgled over some rocks, then she and the rest
                        of the team
                        scattered into the trees. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Standing there alone, with my big blue-feathered helmet and my huge shield, I
                        felt like an
                        idiot. The bronze sword, like all the swords I’d tried so far, seemed balanced wrong. The
                        leather grip pulled on
                        my hand like a bowling ball. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">There was no way anybody would actually attack me, would they? I mean, Olympus
                        had to have
                        liability issues, right? </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Far away, the conch horn blew. I heard whoops and yells in the woods, the
                        clanking of metal,
                        kids fighting. A blue-plumed ally from Apollo raced past me like a deer, leaped through the
                        creek, and
                        disappeared into enemy territory. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Great, I thought. I’ll miss all the fun, as usual. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then I heard a sound that sent a chill up my spine, a low canine growl,
                        somewhere close by.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I raised my shield instinctively; I had the feeling something was stalking me.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then the growling stopped. I felt the presence retreating. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">On the other side of the creek, the underbrush exploded. Five Ares warriors
                        came yelling and
                        screaming out of the dark. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Cream the punk!” Clarisse screamed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Her ugly pig eyes glared through the slits of her helmet. She brandished a
                        five-foot-long
                        spear, its barbed metal tip flickering with red light. Her siblings had only the standard-issue
                        bronze
                        swords—not that that made me feel any better. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">They charged across the stream. There was no help in sight. I could run. Or I
                        could defend
                        myself against half the Ares cabin. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img" src="../assets/images/scenes/8-3.png" alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">I managed to sidestep the first kid’s swing, but these guys were not as stupid
                        as the Minotaur.
                        They surrounded me, and Clarisse thrust at me with her spear. My shield deflected the point, but
                        I felt a
                        painful tingling all over my body. My hair stood on end. My shield arm went numb, and the air
                        burned. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Electricity. Her stupid spear was electric. I fell back. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Another Ares guy slammed me in the chest with the butt of his sword and I hit
                        the dirt. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">They could’ve kicked me into jelly, but they were too busy laughing. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Give him a haircut,” Clarisse said. “Grab his hair.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I managed to get to my feet. I raised my sword, but Clarisse slammed it aside
                        with her spear as
                        sparks flew. Now both my arms felt numb. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, wow,” Clarisse said. “I’m scared of this guy. Really scared.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The flag is that way,” I told her. I wanted to sound angry, but I was afraid
                        it didn’t come
                        out that way. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah,” one of her siblings said. “But see, we don’t care about the flag. We
                        care about a guy
                        who made our cabin look stupid.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You do that without my help,” I told them. It probably wasn’t the smartest
                        thing to say. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Two of them came at me. I backed up toward the creek, tried to raise my shield,
                        but Clarisse
                        was too fast. Her spear stuck me straight in the ribs. If I hadn’t been wearing an armored
                        breastplate, I
                        would’ve been shish-ke-babbed. As it was, the electric point just about shocked my teeth out of
                        my mouth. One of
                        her cabinmates slashed his sword across my arm, leaving a good-size cut. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Seeing my own blood made me dizzy—warm and cold at the same time. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No maiming,” I managed to say. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oops,” the guy said. “Guess I lost my dessert privilege.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He pushed me into the creek and I landed with a splash. They all laughed. I
                        figured as soon as
                        they were through being amused, I would die. But then something happened. The water seemed to
                        wake up my senses,
                        as if I’d just had a bag of my mom’s double-espresso jelly beans. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Clarisse and her cabinmates came into the creek to get me, but I stood to meet
                        them. I knew
                        what to do. I swung the flat of my sword against the first guy’s head and knocked his helmet
                        clean off. I hit
                        him so hard I could see his eyes vibrating as he crumpled into the water. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Ugly Number Two and Ugly Number Three came at me. I slammed one in the face
                        with my shield and
                        used my sword to shear off the other guy’s horsehair plume. Both of them backed up quick. Ugly
                        Number Four
                        didn’t look really anxious to attack, but Clarisse kept coming, the point of her spear crackling
                        with energy. As
                        soon as she thrust, I caught the shaft between the edge of my shield and my sword, and I snapped
                        it like a twig.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Ah!” she screamed. “You idiot! You corpse-breath worm!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She probably would’ve said worse, but I smacked her between the eyes with my
                        sword-butt and
                        sent her stumbling backward out of the creek. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then I heard yelling, elated screams, and I saw Luke racing toward the boundary
                        line with the
                        red team’s banner lifted high. He was flanked by a couple of Hermes guys covering his retreat,
                        and a few Apollos
                        behind them, fighting off the Hephaestus kids. The Ares folks got up, and Clarisse muttered a
                        dazed curse. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“A trick!” she shouted. “It was a trick.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">They staggered after Luke, but it was too late. Everybody converged on the
                        creek as Luke ran
                        across into friendly territory. Our side exploded into cheers. The red banner shimmered and
                        turned to silver.
                        The boar and spear were replaced with a huge caduceus, the symbol of cabin eleven. Everybody on
                        the blue team
                        picked up Luke and started carrying him around on their shoulders. Chiron cantered out from the
                        woods and blew
                        the conch horn. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The game was over. We’d won. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I was about to join the celebration when Annabeth’s voice, right next to me in
                        the creek, said,
                        “Not bad, hero.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I looked, but she wasn’t there. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Where the heck did you learn to fight like that?” she asked. The air
                        shimmered, and she
                        materialized, holding a Yankees baseball cap as if she’d just taken it off her head. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I felt myself getting angry. I wasn’t even fazed by the fact that she’d just
                        been invisible.
                        “You set me up,” I said. “You put me here because you knew Clarisse would come after me, while
                        you sent Luke
                        around the flank. You had it all figured out.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth shrugged. “I told you. Athena always, always has a plan.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“A plan to get me pulverized.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I came as fast as I could. I was about to jump in, but…” She shrugged. “You
                        didn’t need help.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then she noticed my wounded arm. “How did you do that?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Sword cut,” I said. “What do you think?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No. It <em class="calibre5">was </em>a sword cut. Look at it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The blood was gone. Where the huge cut had been, there was a long white
                        scratch, and even that
                        was fading. As I watched, it turned into a small scar, and disappeared. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I—I don’t get it,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth was thinking hard. I could almost see the gears turning. She looked
                        down at my feet,
                        then at Clarisse’s broken spear, and said, “Step out of the water, Percy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Just do it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I came out of the creek and immediately felt bone tired. My arms started to go
                        numb again. My
                        adrenaline rush left me. I almost fell over, but Annabeth steadied me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, Styx,” she cursed. “This is <em class="calibre5">not </em>good. I didn’t
                        want…I assumed it
                        would be Zeus.…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Before I could ask what she meant, I heard that canine growl again, but much
                        closer than
                        before. A howl ripped through the forest. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The campers’ cheering died instantly. Chiron shouted something in Ancient
                        Greek, which I would
                        realize, only later, I had understood perfectly: <em class="calibre5">“Stand ready! My bow!”
                        </em></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth drew her sword. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">There on the rocks just above us was a black hound the size of a rhino, with
                        lava-red eyes and
                        fangs like daggers. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It was looking straight at me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Nobody moved except Annabeth, who yelled, “Percy, run!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She tried to step in front of me, but the hound was too fast. It leaped over
                        her—an enormous
                        shadow with teeth—and just as it hit me, as I stumbled backward and felt its razor-sharp claws
                        ripping through
                        my armor, there was a cascade of thwacking sounds, like forty pieces of paper being ripped one
                        after the other.
                        From the hound’s neck sprouted a cluster of arrows. The monster fell dead at my feet. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">By some miracle, I was still alive. I didn’t want to look underneath the ruins
                        of my shredded
                        armor. My chest felt warm and wet, and I knew I was badly cut. Another second, and the monster
                        would’ve turned
                        me into a hundred pounds of delicatessen meat. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron trotted up next to us, a bow in his hand, his face grim. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><em class="calibre5">“Di immortales!” </em>Annabeth said. “That’s a hellhound
                        from the Fields
                        of Punishment. They don’t…they’re not supposed to…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Someone summoned it,” Chiron said. “Someone inside the camp.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Luke came over, the banner in his hand forgotten, his moment of glory gone.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Clarisse yelled, “It’s all Percy’s fault! Percy summoned it!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Be quiet, child,” Chiron told her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We watched the body of the hellhound melt into shadow, soaking into the ground
                        until it
                        disappeared. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’re wounded,” Annabeth told me. “Quick, Percy, get in the water.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m okay.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No, you’re not,” she said. “Chiron, watch this.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I was too tired to argue. I stepped back into the creek, the whole camp
                        gathering around me.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Instantly, I felt better. I could feel the cuts on my chest closing up. Some of
                        the campers
                        gasped. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Look, I—I don’t know why,” I said, trying to apologize. “I’m sorry.…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">But they weren’t watching my wounds heal. They were staring at something above
                        my head. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy,” Annabeth said, pointing. “Um…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">By the time I looked up, the sign was already fading, but I could still make
                        out the hologram
                        of green light, spinning and gleaming. A three-tipped spear: a trident. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img" src="../assets/images/scenes/8-4.png" alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“Your father,” Annabeth murmured. “This is <em class="calibre5">really </em>not
                        good.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It is determined,” Chiron announced. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">All around me, campers started kneeling, even the Ares cabin, though they
                        didn’t look happy
                        about it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“My father?” I asked, completely bewildered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Poseidon,” said Chiron. “Earthshaker, Stormbringer, Father of Horses. Hail,
                        Perseus Jackson,
                        Son of the Sea God.” </p>
